Alexa ArdMcClatchy', \"The Olympics are underway in Pyeongchang, South Korea. That’s P-y-e-o-n-g-c-h-a-n-g. The city is a little over 120 kilometers east of the capital city, Seoul. It is not to be confused with America’s “Asian-inspired” restaurant franchise P.F. Chang’s. One is a South Korean city and the other is, well, a place you go to eat sad lettuce wraps. Despite this clear difference, Chicago television station WLS-Ch.7 managed to conflate the two in a piece earlier this week. A logo for “P.F. Chang 2018” with some fake Olympic rings popped up on the screen behind one of the station’s broadcasters, Mark Rivera.\\nIn its apology, WLS-CH.7 said the graphic had been created for a “satirical piece” that the station ran earlier during the Games. During that piece, “viewers were encouraged to invent their own Olympic sports,” the Chicago Tribune reports. Because that’s, uh, better.\\nContrary to this broadcast, we’re not hosting the games. 🙂 https://t.co/3HW694pE4J — P.F. Chang's (@PFChangs) February 11, 2018\", 'So why is portraiture returning now? For one, there is an institutional urgency to speak to a more diverse audience with painting that depicts the black community, the Asian-American experience, the Latino face, to attract the various people who had been excluded from the museum by remaking the history of figurative painting, this time with color. Not that the trend toward realist portraits is exclusive to artists of color. It is evident in the rococo renderings of Sam McKinniss, who paints pop culture figures — Prince, Lorde, Flipper — like hallowed aristocrats. It was clear in a series of self-portraits by Justin Vivian Bond — who is best known for experimental cabaret performances — that were displayed at the New Museum last fall, and seemed to casually but definitively announce Bond’s identity as a trans artist.\\nAnd there is another reason for figurative paintings’ resurgence as well: We live in a time in which reality is almost daily warped in ways that were unimaginable even 18 months ago. We have swiftly entered an era where the very notion of truth, or facts, is considered fungible. As we reassess the various power structures that landed us here, it is stabilizing and reassuring to look at the work of an artist who is clearly in control of her craft, who is able to depict a reality that is material and grounded in recognition — of seeing, in the Facebook age, a painting that looks like who it is meant to.\\nTHE CURRENT GENERATION of figurative paintings owes a debt to Kerry James Marshall, whose 2016 multicity retrospective cemented the artist’s often-stated goal, one that is as straightforward as it is enormous: to put blackness into art history. The painter’s brilliantly simple gambit, one that has allowed for decades of elaboration, was to literalize that blackness. Starting in 1980 with a mischievous little egg-tempera — “A Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self,” which features a grin missing a crucial tooth — Marshall has painted his African-American subjects mostly in unmixed black paint. Ever since, these figures have been seen — boldly and yet barely — in a variety of settings: the artist’s studio, the hairdresser’s, parks, bedrooms, outer space. Their blackness makes each inclusion subtly register as an exclusion.\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nThis idea is expanded upon in the work of Amy Sherald, who was Michelle Obama’s choice to paint her official portrait. Sherald uses grisaille — a method of painting in gray monochrome — for her subjects’ skin. Because her gradations slyly allude to the mixed and often unacknowledged backgrounds of African-Americans, Sherald’s paintings make an important statement about our racial history. One 2016 image, “Listen, You a Wonder. You a City of a Woman. You Got a Geography of Your Own,” features a woman wearing a skirt dotted with black flowers. As if to underline the point, she is suspending a black purse in front of her belly.\\nPhoto\\nArtists like Marshall and Sherald suggest that in its exclusion of people of color, the issue of representation in painting is really a matter of misrepresentation. The best portrait painters working today introduce something new into art not through stylistic innovations, but by whom they choose as subjects. Aliza Nisenbaum, who was among the most prominent artists in last year’s Whitney Biennial, looks at undocumented immigrants from Latin America in her work. The artist, who hails from Mexico City, shifted her painting practice from abstract to portraiture around 2010, while working with Cuban artist Tania Bruguera’s Immigrant Movement International, an art project in Queens which provides social services to the neighborhood’s large immigrant community. Nisenbaum realized that the portrait process — long, slow, intimate — gave her a way to get to know this community. Additionally, she recognized that painting these people’s pictures would be one way to address their erasure in other areas of life. Nisenbaum has since expanded the project to include portrait-making workshops for the immigrants themselves. As if to complete the circle, the 2017 work “Wise Elders Portraiture Class at Centro Tyrone Guzman. En Familia hay Fuerza with mural on the history of immigrant farm labor to the United States,” shows the students holding the portraits they themselves learned to draw.\\nPhoto\\nWhat’s most surprising about the recent return of classical portraiture is realizing how utterly absent it was from the art world for so many years, to such an extent that Andy Warhol — one of the people ostensibly responsible for killing the form — helped found the New York Academy of Art in 1982 in order to salvage the kind of technical fine arts training (most notably figure drawing) that seemed at the time in danger of becoming extinct. The Neo-Expressionism of the 1980s — led by painters like Julian Schnabel and David Salle — helped popularize abstraction by making it into a desirable commodity, but it also rendered the realism of a painter like Alice Neel passé. But painting, perhaps because it is so old, seems unusually inclined to rebirth, to responding to its time in surprising ways. As the commercialism of the art world expanded in the 2010s, painting became a subset of interior decorating, something that was easy to mass produce and inoffensive to live with: paintings marked by bold colors and forms, sometimes literally depicting flowers (the work of Nate Lowman) or sunsets (Alex Israel). In 2014, at the peak of this stylistic moment, New York’s Museum of Modern Art hung its first survey composed exclusively of contemporary painting since 1958, “The Forever Now,” a show that responded to the current age of distraction, in which contemporaneity was constantly being replaced by something newer. Only the works of Amy Sillman and Nicole Eisenman, who both have portrait-painting practices, hinted at the fact that in our next, emphatically historical moment, something old would be doing the replacing.\\nBut an ever-widening chasm exists between 2014 and today. If the news of the world feels every day more like a pulpy political thriller with an unhinged plotline, painters have responded by grounding their work in observable, human reality. Most of this work isn’t overtly political on its surface — there is Henry Taylor’s monumental 2012 portrait of a woman grilling chicken on a barbecue, or Celeste Dupuy-Spencer’s 2016 painting of a man making a playlist on his laptop, a cigarette-filled ashtray in front of him. But they also suggest that, in a time of chaos, there could be nothing more necessary — more defiant — than simply showing life as it’s being lived.', \"-All Event Categories- FALL ARTS FOOD & DRINK Drink Events Food Events New Year's Day Brunch New Year's Eve Dining Thanksgiving Valentine's Day GALLERIES & MUSEUMS Galleries Galleries: Openings & Receptions Museums Museums: Openings & Receptions Special Events HOLIDAY EVENTS LIT & LECTURES Chicago Humanities Festival Lectures Literary Events MUSIC Blues, Gospel, and R&B Classical Dance Experimental Fairs & Festivals Folk & Country Hip-Hop In-Stores International Jazz Miscellaneous Open Mikes and Jams Rock, Pop, Etc OTHER STUFF Green Events Halloween Holiday Shopping Inaugural Events New Year's Eve Parties & Events Parties Pride Weekend St. Patrick's Day Valentine's Day PERFORMING ARTS Dance Holiday Shows Improv/Sketch Spoken Word/Poetry Slams/Open Mikes Stand-Up Theater & Performance SPONSORED SUMMER GUIDE Beer Biking Dog-Friendly Fairs & Festivals Farmers Markets Illinois Indiana Lake & River Michigan Music Festivals Scavenger Hunts & Races Wisconsin\\n-All Neighborhoods- CENTRAL Gold Coast/Mag Mile/Streeterville Loop Museum Campus Near North Near South Side Printers Row River North South Loop Other Central *REGION UNDEFINED NORTH Albany Park Andersonville DePaul Edgewater Lakeview Lincoln Park Lincoln Square North Center Old Town Ravenswood Rogers Park/West Rogers Park Roscoe Village Uptown West Ridge Wrigleyville Other North NORTHWEST Avondale Belmont Cragin Irving Park Jefferson Park Logan Square Portage Park Other Northwest WEST Austin Garfield Park Greektown Humboldt Park Lawndale University Village/Little Italy Near West Side River West Ukrainian Village/East Village United Center West Loop/Fulton Market Wicker Park/Bucktown West Town/Noble Square Other West SOUTH SIDE Pilsen/Little Village Beverly Bridgeport Bronzeville Bronzeville/ Kenwood/ Washington Park Chatham Chinatown Englewood Hyde Park Oakland/ Kenwood Pullman South Shore Washington Park Woodlawn Other South SOUTHWEST Brighton Park Ford City Marquette Park McKinley Park West Lawn Other Southwest SUBURBS NORTH Evanston Lincolnwood Skokie Other Suburbs North SUBURBS NORTHWEST Suburbs Northwest Other Suburbs Northwest SUBURBS WEST Other Suburbs West Berwyn Cicero Forest Park Oak Park/River Forest SUBURBS SOUTH Suburbs South SUBURBS SOUTHWEST Suburbs Southwest OUT OF STATE Indiana Wisconsin OTHER ILLINOIS Other Illinois\\n-All Films- Acrimony Annihilation Black Panther Black Panther 3D The Death of Stalin Death Wish Flower Foxtrot Furusato Game Night God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness Goldstone The Guardians I Can Only Imagine I, Tonya Intimités: Everyday Life in Contemporary Afro-French Cinema Isle of Dogs Journey's End Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle Keep the Change Leaning Into the Wind Lost in Translation Love, Simon Madame Midnight Sun Pacific Rim: Uprising Pacific Rim: Uprising -- An IMAX 3D Experience Pacific Rim: Uprising -- The IMAX 2D Experience Pacific Rim: Uprising 3D The Party Paul, Apostle of Christ Peter Rabbit Ready Player One Ready Player One 3D Ready Player One: An IMAX 3D Experience Red Sparrow Rogers Park Seconds 7 Days in Entebbe Sherlock Gnomes Sherlock Gnomes 3D Star Wars: The Last Jedi The Strangers: Prey at Night Thoroughbreds Tomb Raider Tomb Raider 3D Tyler Perry's Acrimony Unsane A Wrinkle in Time 3D A Wrinkle in Time\", 'click to enlarge Alex Wroblewski / Sun-Times\\nLupe Fiasco performs at the first Aahh! Fest in 2014.\\nHappy Birthday To My Real Brothers Harold “Huggy Bear” Perkins...this one dedicated to you big bro! Love 🙏🏾 couldn’t find a gift so I figured I bring you back to the crib one time...\\nFrom the vaults “Harold’s” prod. By Chris Dave#TheChi pic.twitter.com/SHs0Y5uljt — DROGASLight Out Now! (@LupeFiasco) February 5, 2018\\nUncle Remus fry they chicken in lard. #NoPorkOnTheFork 🙅🏾\\u200d♂️ https://t.co/qtq7YeJS4R — DROGASLight Out Now! (@LupeFiasco) February 6, 2018\\nOn Sunday Lupe Fiasco tweeted the video for an unreleased track called \"Harold\\'s\" he composed as a birthday gift for a friend, and, yes, it\\'s all about the beloved fried chicken joint . The lithe soul number barely crosses the two-minute mark, but that\\'s more than enough time for Lupe to unload delectable descriptions of the restaurant\\'s fried fowl, a \"southern delight, supper color the white.\"Lupe\\'s tune adds a new chapter to the book of Harold\\'s references in Chicago hip-hop. You can trace the history back to Common\\'s 1992 debut, Can I Borrow a Dollar? , which includes a couple tracks produced by the team of the Twilite Tone and No I.D. under the name \"2pc DRK\" (yep, that\\'s a Harold\\'s order). More recently, Chance the Rapper gave his favorite Harold\\'s location a shout-out on \"First Mixtape Based Freestyle,\" a track on the collaborative mixtape he cut with Bay Area iconoclast Lil B, Free (Based Freestyles Mixtape). And who can forget Chance\\'s birthday cake from last year , which was decorated with the Harold\\'s logo and icing resembling fried chicken, fries, and mild sauce?Lupe makes a persuasive case for Harold\\'s supremacy, which, as he aptly describes it, \"Makes KFC taste like Mississippi river rat.\"A song called \"Harold\\'s\" was on the potential track list for, Lupe\\'s sixth full-length album and first since leaving Atlantic Records. Maybe it wouldn\\'t have sagged quite as bad with this \"Harold\\'s\" in the middle.One thing did stick in my craw about that track, though: Lupe\\'s a west-side native, which means his allegiance should be to the lesser-known but fiercely loved chicken chain Uncle Remus.Confused, I posted my question about why the west-sider would make a song about a south-side institution on Twitter yesterday. Lupe responded rather quickly: \"Uncle Remus fry they chicken in lard. #NoPorkOnTheFork.\"That makes more sense, considering Lupe is Muslim and pork ain\\'t halal. I tried to reach Lupe for more insights about the track, but couldn\\'t get him on the phone.Undeterred, I decided to call up a few Harold\\'s locations to see if any managers had listened to Lupe\\'s track. I got in touch with Norm Lewis, who runs the West Loop joint. \"Yeah, I heard it,\" he tells me. \"That’s my store that\\'s in the video.\" In fact, the video, which Lupe ripped from YouTube, opens with a shot of the restaurant\\'s sign and its address before rolling through tantalizing B-roll footage of Lewis\\'s employees frying chicken and squeezing mild sauce on a combo order. Lewis had no idea footage of his restaurant would wind up in a Lupe Fiasco video, though he had noticed a cameraman pop by the restaurant months ago. \"Yeah, I seen the guy in the kitchen [filming] and everything,\" Lewis says. \"But I didn’t know he was doing the video for Lupe Fiasco.\"The video arrived at a great time for Lewis. In September, the West Loop location moved to 1505 W. Madison, roughly a mile west of the previous location at the corner of Washington and Halsted.

During last month\\'s Major League Barber Original Midwest SuperBarber & Stylist Tradeshow at the Donald E. Stephens Convention Center in Rosemont, the 39-year-old took first place in the Fastest and Cleanest Fade event. He spoke about how he got immersed in the world of competitive barbering.\\nWhen I was younger, my parents couldn\\'t afford to send me to the barber shop. My father, he used to cut my hair, but he wasn\\'t a barber. It was rough because coming up in inner-city Chicago, if you didn\\'t have a good haircut, you got talked about. So me and my brothers started practicing on each other. I never wanted to be a barber. I just wanted a good haircut so people would stop bullying me.\\nI\\'m the type that when I do something, I want to master it, so I was like, \"OK, let me practice on myself.\" After a while, when my friends started coming to me—\"Hey, can you line me up?\"—I knew I was getting better. After a while they started to offer me, like, $2. By the time I graduated high school, I was averaging $50, $60 cash money, every single day.\\nI wanted to go to barber school, but to my mother, it was like, \"This sounds like you just want to hang out.\" In the late 90s, a lot of my friends were in gangs, selling drugs. If I went to barber school, I\\'d be hanging out with these same guys. She knew the trouble they got in was eventually gonna rub off on me.\\nSo I went to college, and I flunked out, because I barely went to class, because I was cutting hair. I\\'m a perfectionist. Cutting hair is like art to me: \"OK, I\\'m late to psychology, but I want to make sure this line is crispy.\" I got put on academic probation and had to sit out a semester, and what my mother told me was gonna happen, actually did happen. I was hanging out with my friends, selling drugs, and when they went to jail, I went to jail.\\nThe public defender convinced me to plead no contest, so I got a felony on my record. That kind of shifted my future, you feel me? It was like, \"Cut hair, or work for day labor and get less than everybody else,\" \\'cause I was a felon. That\\'s what made me get good at cutting hair, \\'cause it was all I had.\\nI started cutting on my back porch. There was a barber shop that opened across the street, and everybody who came on the porch would tell me, \"Why aren\\'t you cutting hair in the shop right there?\" One day the owner came out and walked across the lot. I\\'m thinking he\\'s gonna muscle me. He didn\\'t come over there and entice me or nothing like that. He said, \"Ain\\'t you tired of making this little change on this back porch? What you need to do is come over here to the barber shop and make some real money.\" I felt like LeBron. I felt like Kobe. I was 20 years old.\\nI opened up Madison Street Barbers in October 2014. The most popular cuts are low fades, mohawks, high-top fades, all those old-school retro cuts. But I do everything. I do comb-overs, I do razor fades. I do straight-razor, hot-towel shaves. I do color. I do bleaching jobs. All that. Every once in a while, I\\'ll get somebody who wants something custom. This one guy has a clothing line, and he wanted me to put the logo of his clothing line on his head.\\nMy first show was MLB, the Major League Barber Original Midwest SuperBarber & Stylist Tradeshow, in January last year. I got second place in freestyle design. When I won that, you couldn\\'t tell me nothing. You know how hard it is to win in Chicago? There are a lot of dope barbers in Chicago. From then to right now, I been in damn near every competition. I\\'ve won 16 trophies. I\\'m kind of like the trophy addict of the barber industry right now. This year at MLB, I got first place for fastest fade. I did a haircut in 13 minutes and 20 seconds.\\nOutside of a barber shop, men don\\'t really have many places they can go and just be men. Sometimes you might want to go somewhere and have a guy ask you, \"What\\'s wrong?\" I\\'m that guy. I\\'m gonna talk with you. We gonna laugh, we gonna joke. And I don\\'t repeat nothing. My clients know I don\\'t tell their business. I had a guy that came through the shop, and his whole income tax got took. He was just feeling really bad. I gave him a nice haircut, and he said, \"I feel a lot better, man. I feel so much better.\" \\xa0v', \"Those men decided, in screening about 1,200 men and 200 women, that good programmers don’t like people — that they have a complete disinterest in people. These tests were widely influential and used at various companies for decades.\\nWhat happens with that is that if you search for antisocial people, you will hire far more men than women. There’s no evidence to suggest that antisocial men are better at computers than women. But that stereotype has perpetuated to this day.\\nPWT How intractable is the tech industry’s exclusion of women?\\nEC It is systemic. Bad behavior has been tolerated and normalized for far too long. And people simply have a narrow idea of who can do these tech jobs. If you’re a woman in the tech industry, you’re the only woman in the room over and over again.\\nPWT What did you find were some of the most egregious examples of how women in tech were treated?\\nEC The party and social culture was really shocking. For two years, I interviewed dozens of people familiar with the sex party scene or who were shut out because of it. I was shocked. It was a lot less about sex than it was about power, and the power dynamic is completely lopsided.\\nPWT What surprised you the most of the tales that women in tech shared with you?\\nEC One of the most surprising things to me was that they weren’t surprised by what Susan Fowler (the former Uber engineer who last year publicly described sexual harassment at the ride-hailing company) wrote. This is their life, day in and day out. The women talk about performing this emotional labor all the time that men simply don’t have to do, and it’s exhausting. At the end of the day, they’re tired because they feel like they’re doing two jobs, not one.\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

These stories have to be told; otherwise, it perpetuates a culture of keeping women down.\\nPWT You have been trolled on Twitter, as many women in tech have been. Did you experience other forms of harassment?\\nEC As a journalist, I’ve definitely found myself in situations that have made me feel uncomfortable. But I’m sure it doesn’t compare to what the women in tech face every single day because they’re simply so outnumbered. I talked to women engineers at Uber who were getting invited to strip clubs and bondage clubs in the middle of the day. The middle of the day! And often they would go because that’s just what everyone was doing. It’s what you needed to do to fit in and be cool.\\nPWT What are the chances that Silicon Valley really changes how it treats women?\\nEC I’m encouraged because I see great examples. The same people who want to change the world — who are exploring the limits of outer space and building floating ocean communities and building self-driving cars — can do this. Change needs to come from the top and C.E.O.s need to make inclusion an explicit focus and priority and communicate that to people in the organization so that they, too, make it a priority\\nPWT You have three young sons, who you dedicate the book to. What are the implications for them?\\nEC When things got hard — because it’s not easy to report on sexism — I’d look at the boys and think “I’m doing this for them.” I really do think their lives will be better in a more equal world.\\nMore importantly, Silicon Valley is controlling what we see, what we read, how we shop, how we communicate, how we relate to each other. This is not just tech’s problem. This is society’s problem. This is the industry that is having a greater influence on humanity than perhaps any other. And the same industry that changed the world can change this behavior.\", 'In the aftermath of the chaos that erupted in Philadelphia as Eagles fans tore through the streets celebrating their Super Bowl victory, many could not help but notice the difference in how the public and officials reacted to riots by fans compared to those prompted by civil unrest.\\n\"Somehow, it seems there\\'s a line drawn in the sand where destruction of property because of a sports victory is OK and acceptable in America.

Diddy, Nelly and a marching band. (Mr. Timberlake had already been in one of those MTV mash-ups three years earlier as a member of ’N Sync.) After some raunchy rap-rock from a flag-draped Kid Rock, Ms. Jackson strutted through a fiery, heartfelt performance of “Rhythm Nation” — demanding, “People of the world, unite!” — that few now remember.\\nIt was overshadowed, of course, by Mr. Timberlake’s closing duet with Ms. Jackson, in his blatantly Michael Jackson-styled song “Rock Your Body.” Staged as a flirtation with Ms. Jackson, it ended with Mr. Timberlake singing “Bet I’ll have you naked by the end of this song” as he tore away more of her costume than had been planned, to reveal — live and televised worldwide for a full 9/16 of a second — her uncovered breast (though jewelry hid her nipple).\\nPhoto\\nHer career, far more original than his, plummeted. MTV and other radio and video outlets effectively blacklisted her music, wrecking the commercial prospects of her 2004 album, “Damita Jo.” Meanwhile, Mr. Timberlake’s career kept moving along. At the Grammy Awards, which that year followed the Super Bowl, he won two awards, while apologizing for the “unintentional” incident.\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nMore than a decade later, particularly in the context of the #MeToo movement, the situation comes across as a demonstration of the victim-blaming that sustains male privilege. He grabbed, she was vulnerable — yet she faced the consequences. In a video promo for this year’s Super Bowl show, an interviewer, Mike Tirico, puts upfront a question about the “wardrobe thing”; with a laugh, Mr. Timberlake assures him, “That won’t happen this time.” Later, Mr. Timberlake declares that the theme of the 2018 halftime show will be “unity.” Ms. Jackson has maintained her silence.', 'I\\'ve recently learned there\\'s no more appropriate viewing when gnawing on a cold duck neck than the Syfy vampire gorefest Van Helsing, which can be a colorful primer on how to eat your way around cervical vertebrae.\\nWell, maybe you\\'d approach a human neck differently, but at Bridgeport\\'s A Place by Damao, you just pick up the bird\\'s nape from each end and get in there, nicking precious scraps of spice- and soy-braised flesh out of the curves and angles of the tiny vertebrae like a merciless, red-fanged predator. If you happen to have a higher opinion of your manners, you can slip on a pair of the thin, clear plastic gloves you\\'ll be offered. You\\'ll miss some of fun, though—like licking the thick Sichuan peppercorn rub from your fingertips. It buzzes like it\\'s still alive.\\nSame thing applies to the duck wings, duck feet, duck tongues, and duck heads you\\'ll find under a glass display case by the register at the rear of this tiny strip-mall storefront. The prominent flat-screen television throws a glow on hotel pans full of chewy chicken gizzards, snappy pork ears, and wiry chicken feet. These various bites are served cold, as you\\'d find them on the street in Chengdu, China. A Place by Damao doesn\\'t have a liquor license, so if you imbibe, you want to be sure you come prepared with your favorite poison, because this is ideal drinking food. I drank cheap Riesling one night and three different kinds of mezcal on another. Doesn\\'t matter. You\\'ll be working at it, and the booze helps you enjoy it more.\\nA Place by Damao is the creation of 24-year-old Aishan \"Damao\" Zhong and partner Mori Guo, who are emblematic of a new Chinatown that\\'s bleeding into Bridgeport and becoming ever more interesting with the arrivals of young fresh blood. Opening last August to daunting lines, the tiny space is smartly appointed with painted wooden boards on the walls announcing the dishes in Chinese.\\nIllustrator Qin Ma also designed the menu with an eye to its clarity for non-Chinese speakers; its hand-drawn and -labeled cartoon diagrams of eight iconic \"Chengdu Famous Plates\" will let you know that, e.g., the soft spicy bean curd is topped with minced green onion, pickled cabbage, and soybeans as well as house-made chile oil. What it doesn\\'t show is what a luxurious pleasure this dish is: diaphanous clouds of tofu slip down the throat on a warm, red tide, the crunchy soybeans adding a reversal of texture, the cabbage\\'s pungent punch and the onion\\'s grassy bite adding another. I\\'d purchase screen prints of these illustrations if they were for sale.\\nThe menu is a bit more obtuse in its rendering of the handmade bell dumplings hiding a dark deposit of sweet \"Secret sauce by Damao.\" These are slim but stout-walled flat half moons wrapped around tightly molded gobs of gingery ground pork. In terms of dumplings, they\\'re nearly as satisfying as the wontons in hot soup, fat but relatively thin-skinned, bulging with ground pork and nestled winsomely in a volcanic full-bodied chicken-and-beef broth that\\'s clear evidence of the compatibility of pleasure and pain.\\nThat soup is among the spiciest dishes on hand at Damao. Another is a deceptively innocuous-looking pile of crinkle-cut french fries, intentionally just cooked to a state of softness that helps absorb another gently sweet and spicy \"secret sauce,\" the crack that compels you to reach for these steadily and repeatedly until they\\'re gone. It\\'s a flavor profile similar to the marvelous thick handmade noodles, cut with sesame and showered with crushed peanuts. A sliced chub of crimson-stained, fat-flecked pork sausage poses the same threat of heat; its look says Oktoberfest, but its slow, menacing burn doesn\\'t exist anywhere in Europe.\\nI realize that—to at least a few of you—brains are a tough sell. But remember how good I said the aforementioned soft spicy bean curd was? Imagine what you\\'d do if you had lots of pigs, but no soybeans. A special I hope remains forever on the menu is a small dish of brain matter, its distinctive anatomical characteristics obscured by chile oil and chopped fresh cilantro. It\\'s an empty vessel that absorbs these seasonings and transmits them to your own nervous system via soft, custardlike lobular formations.\\nA special spicy noodle soup with braised beef is no slouch either. Deeply rich, almost a balm to some of the more assertive liquids on the menu, it harbors fatty slices of meat that fall apart at the touch of the tongue. Firm spaghetti–bore wheat noodles are the third player in this remarkable bowl.\\nA trio of barbecued meats fills out this focused menu. Shredded caramelized rabbit bits are the Sichuanese answer to classic Chicago-style ribs tips. I\\'ll never understand cigars, but I imagine their appeal is similar to that of the lingering smokiness these meaty scraps provide as you deliberately work through the shattered skeletal structure. Equally smoky roasted pig feet are easier to deal with, the warm, jellylike collagen being the draw here, with bigger and fewer bones to get in the way. Tiny pork riblets may be the gateway meat: dry-rubbed, with a hint of sweetness, the flesh separates from the bones with little effort or interference.\\nThere\\'s a singular sweet on the menu: a \"teardrop cake\" (here \"iced water cake\"), a parfait-like assemblage of clear water, sugar, and agar jelly that was blowing up the Internet last summer. Usually served inverted, at Damao it\\'s presented in a bowl in a couple of variations: one with subtly boozy and astringent fermented rice; one with brown sugar, dried hawthorn, sesame seeds, and raisins; and one that\\'s a combination of the two. It\\'s a cool, Achatzesque reward for your palate\\'s previous exertions.\\nSome people maintain Sichuan food is one-dimensional, all tongue-numbing oily burn and buzz. But that neglects the variety of diverting visceral textures it offers. More than most Sichuan restaurants in Chinatown, Damao is a place with food for lingering over important ideas, gesturing emphatically with denuded duck tongues and chicken feet. This style of eating may be old hat in Chengdu, but in Chicago it looks like a bright future for Chinese food. v', 'Last week, I read the Babe.net article describing an encounter between comedian Aziz Ansari and a woman identified only as “Grace.” I read about how Ansari allegedly pushed past several verbal and nonverbal cues suggesting that Grace was not comfortable with their sexual encounter. I had a sickening moment of truth: I’ve done that.\\nIt was just over four years ago. I was 22, newly single, and in college. I had just broken up with my long-distance girlfriend of five years and had spent the past few years hearing all about my friends’ and roommates’ hookups. I was excited to be single and date around. I kept a mental list of several women around school whom I wanted to sleep with.\\nI had an acquaintance, “Julie,” who was on that list. I’m not using her real name here, and I’m writing this piece anonymously, to protect both of our privacy. We had been to parties together, laughed together, and on a couple of occasions, I had walked her home. We liked each other enough to flirt, which eventually turned into the occasional texting conversation or phone call. I got the sense she was attracted to me.\\nAfter a couple of weeks of texting, Julie invited me on a trip to her home a few hours away from campus. I felt a little weird about going, as we didn’t know each other very well. But I said yes — to me, the invite felt like a pretty big sign that she wanted to hook up, and I was eager to have sex.\\nWe arranged our travel plans. She would drive her car, and I would sleep over at her place the night before we left because we had to wake up early.\\nThat night, Julie and I hooked up — and I ignored several of her verbal and nonverbal cues telling me to stop. Years later, I have come to believe that I came alarmingly close to raping her. I’m still disturbed by how normal it felt at the time.\\nThe verbal and nonverbal cues I ignored\\nI arrived at Julie’s house at around 11 pm. We walked upstairs to her bedroom, which was small and cozy, lit by a star-shaped lamp.\\nI looked around. Her mattress was basically the only thing to sit or sleep on. It was clear — we would be sharing the bed. My face flushed, and my heart beat faster. I took this as a sign that a hookup would happen.\\nI lay in bed with Julie, her head resting comfortably on my chest, and we talked about this and that. We were dozing off a bit when we both turned on our sides to face each other. I could see her eyes were closed, but I sensed she was still awake. I touched my forehead to hers. She brought her mouth to mine, and we kissed.\\nAs we were making out, we couldn’t find our rhythm. It felt like either her mouth was too small for mine or my mouth was too big. It seemed like she didn’t want to open hers all the way. I kept finding her teeth with my tongue, or going in for a mouth-half-open kiss, only to land on her pursed-shut lips. In the moment, I blamed first-hookup awkwardness.\\nI moved my hands under her shirt, pulled her close, grabbed her ass, and hoisted her above me so she could straddle my waist. It seemed sexy. She was still kissing me. I took off her shirt and bra.\\nAt some point, I went down on her. I don’t remember any verbal cues to stop, but what I do remember is a significant nonverbal cue: She wasn’t making any sound. No moans, no breaths, no words. She seemed stiff. But I kept going because, well, I thought that oral sex was something people typically enjoyed. I worried I wasn’t doing it right, so I tried different spots and techniques, but nothing changed.\\nAfter some time, which I now realize was far too long, I stopped and asked if she was okay. She hesitated before speaking, and sat up.\\n“I don’t think we should have sex. We’re friends, and I think having sex will make things complicated.”\\nI responded almost immediately. “I don’t think it will make things complicated. I’m totally fine with figuring that out later.” I kind of laughed, I think, because I thought I was being charming. My feelings at the time were: We’re in the middle of having sex. It’s already complicated. Stopping now doesn’t make it less complicated. I was also horny, and Julie was hot, so I disregarded her feelings; I lurched toward her and starting kissing her neck.\\n“Are you sure you want to stop?” I whispered in her ear as I moved my hand toward her crotch.\\n“I just don’t think we should, because we’re friends.”\\nShe never physically stopped me from touching her. At the time, I took that as a sign that she actually wanted me to continue. Her verbal objections, I convinced myself, were her poetic way of telling me she liked me enough to want to be in a relationship with me.\\nShe was telling me to stop. And I didn’t. At least not at first. Instead, I continued to touch her clitoris, kiss her neck, and take off my underwear. She continued to say nothing and do nothing, and she was still stiff. I rubbed my penis across the outside of her vagina. She was wet. I convinced myself that this was further evidence that she wanted it.\\nI positioned myself for penetration but paused right before pushing inside her. At that point, things kind of snapped together for me. She didn’t want this — maybe she hadn’t pushed my hand away, but she had verbalized not feeling comfortable doing it. So I stopped.\\nIt took me years to realize that even though I stopped, I’d still violated her.\\nI don’t remember what I said then. I don’t remember what she said either. But I remember that we talked in bed for a while. It felt normal. The next morning, we drove to her house. I met her mom and her old friends. We saw her old neighborhood. It was polite and pleasant but much less flirtatious. We didn’t have sex. I kissed her on the cheek when I said goodbye. After that, nothing really happened between Julie and me. I saw her around school, but that was it. I still follow her on Instagram.\\nI remember talking with my roommate after I got home. She wanted to know how my weekend went — I told her that Julie and I didn’t have sex because she wanted us to stay friends. I remember saying, “I hate when people aren’t clear about what they want. She seemed like she wanted to fuck me, so I kept going, but all she kept saying was that it would be weird. If she didn’t want to fuck me, she should have just said so.”\\nI realize now that this was my problem, not Julie’s.\\nToxic masculinity affects all men\\nI considered myself a feminist back then. I still do — I fight for gender equality, and I actively try to be a better man every day. But it still took me years to realize that what I did to Julie was wrong. It was coercive. She told me she “didn’t think we should have sex,” and I kept trying anyway.\\nI thought I was getting signals from Julie that she wanted to have sex before the encounter started — the flirting, inviting me to her home. Maybe she did want to have sex. But at some point, she changed her mind or, at the very least, wasn’t sure how she was feeling. It wasn’t enthusiastic consent throughout, and at two different points, she objected. I ignored that.\\nIn the years following the incident with Julie, I began to realize, often while reading articles online about enthusiastic consent, that what had happened between us wasn’t fully consensual. But it wasn’t until I read the Aziz Ansari story and the media conversation surrounding it that I realized the extent of what I had done.\\nI’m still not sure what to call what I did — assault? Coercion? A violation? What I do believe is this: If I hadn’t stopped when I stopped, I would have committed rape. But in that moment, it didn’t feel that way — it felt normal. I had convinced myself that she still wanted me despite her objections.\\nI don’t think I’m the only man who has done something like this. I think rape culture is so pervasive that men sometimes don’t realize when we’re actively committing assault. When Grace confronted Ansari via text message after their night together, he responded: “Clearly, I misread things in the moment.”\\nWith Julie, I was aware of her verbal and nonverbal cues. But I had been socially conditioned to believe that women would want to have sex with me if I could convince them. I remember watching teen movies like Superbad and American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile, where men were portrayed as entitled to sex with women simply because these men were virgins and it was their “rite of passage.” My first orgasm was while watching internet porn, where consent to have sex is implicit. My middle school health class taught me about anatomy and drugs, but never consent.\\nAs I aged, I ignored discussions of consent because I believed all sorts of myths about rape: that it’s only something that happens violently between strangers, when the woman is completely drunk, or between a powerful older man and a much younger woman. I never got the message that rape and assault was happening to women all around me and being perpetrated by men just like me.\\nToxic masculinity praises sexually active men. Sex is conquest, competition, and a measure of self-worth. There is rarely a punishment for pressuring a woman to have sex with us — there is only, we are taught, the reward of sexual pleasure if we succeed.\\nBut what we need to do is admit our faults. There are a million ways to say no, and we need to stop ignoring them. We need to make “enthusiastic consent” our mantra and keep it in mind whenever we might have sex.\\nI’m engaged now and have been with the same partner for four years. In the years following the incident with Julie, I’ve changed my behavior in bed. I try to let go of penetrative sex as a goal. I spent my younger years learning about foreplay and intimacy as a “means to an end.” Now intimacy, in all forms, is the end. The best way to get there is to listen to my partner’s words, actions, and body throughout sexual encounters — even if that means stopping sex in its tracks. That is its own form of intimacy.\\nI haven’t talked to Julie in years. I’ve thought about reaching out to apologize to her, but I’ve decided against it because it could upset her. Instead, I’m committed to continuing to change how I approach sex, and always making sure there is “fuck yes” affirmative consent.\\nI also want to talk to other men about this issue — it’s a conversation I’ve had with male friends, though not regularly. I remember one instance when two male friends and I were talking about sex, and we all admitted to engaging in some type of coercive behavior. None of us were proud of it. These are the kinds of discussions that need to keep happening.\\nMen, especially the most liberal, caring, and self-aware among us: look harder at yourselves. Rape culture ends when we stop raping.\\nFirst Person is Vox’s home for compelling, provocative narrative essays. Do you have a story to share?

Still, when you live on the 25th floor of a Manhattan high-rise, you can’t hang one outside the window and risk knocking off a pedestrian below. Several winters ago, I sat at my desk lamenting this fact while gazing across the gray expanse of chimneys and water towers stretching to the East River and beyond. I was holed up in my apartment working on a book about a fish: the storied Asian arowana, a swamp-dwelling endangered species rumored to fetch up to $300,000 as a pet. After chasing the creature around the globe for more than three years, I was now confined indoors, buried in drifts of notes. Each time I attempted to force my thoughts underwater, I found myself staring out the window, longing to see birds in the city sky. Traveling the world to see microbes, plants, and animals in oceans, grasslands, forests, deserts, the icy poles—and wherever else they may be.\\nRead more Having sworn off swamps, I missed a connection to the wild. Seeking a remedy, I discovered a small Maine company called Coveside Conservation Products, which makes a unique “Panoramic in-House Window Bird Feeder.” A semicircular mahogany platform enclosed with plexiglass, the feeder fits into an open window and juts inward, providing a front-row view of birds bold enough to enter. No part of the contraption dangles outside, presumably rendering it safe for urban use. In reply to my enthusiastic query, however, Coveside’s owner, Jim Turpin, was less than a salesman. “Frankly, I’m not overly optimistic about attracting birds to feed in a high-rise setting,” he wrote, explaining that most species search for food at specific heights. He pointed me to the website of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, where someone had inquired about luring birds to a 17th-floor balcony. The answer—that attractive foliage can help, but don’t hold your breath—wasn’t promising, considering I don’t have a balcony and scarcely overlook a tree.\\nNevertheless, I ordered the feeder, filled it with birdseed, and installed it in my window, where it interrupted the soundproofing, so I found myself working amid a cacophony of sirens and jackhammering. Two hundred and fifty feet above ground—the height of the tallest giant sequoias in the Sierra Nevada—the wind howls more often than not. Despite my best efforts to insulate the edges of the wobbly wooden feeder, freezing January air whistled through the apartment, slamming shut any door left ajar. My husband, Jeff, was not thrilled. But then, as a native New Yorker, he is not exactly Mr. Nature. Once, when we were dating, we went on a short hike in New Jersey, where he strode purposefully to the edge of the woods, leaned into the trees, and began uttering a convincing trilling call followed by a kind of whirring and honking. I was impressed until I realized he was mimicking a car alarm. Traditional wisdom dictates that birds don’t become dependent on a free lunch. Now, as our thermostat plummeted, I told Jeff not to worry—that I just wanted to see if I could attract a pigeon or two, inevitably followed by a zillion pigeons, at which point I’d have to take the feeder down. Yet no pigeon appeared. Weeks passed. Chilly, noisy weeks. I began working in the industrial-grade construction earmuffs I’d bought when masons were repointing our building’s facade, grinding out the mortar between the bricks.\\nThen, one morning in March, as I brewed coffee in the kitchen, Jeff strode into the office and sprang back out again, announcing he’d seen a flash of red. I joined him, and we peered around the door until the startled visitor worked up the courage to return. A cherry gum ball of a head poked up from the ledge and cocked to one side, uttering an inquisitive chirp and inspecting the room from behind plexiglass. Once satisfied that all was clear, a sparrow-size creature with a blushing breast and triangular beak hopped into the feeder. I recognized it immediately as a house finch. It was one of the few birds I could’ve identified, having reported, some years back, on a novel strain of bacterial conjunctivitis that jumped to the species in the mid-’90s from domesticated poultry around Washington, D.C. The epidemic moved like pink eye through a preschool, rendering many infected finches virtually blind. Millions perished—a heavy blow to a species ranked among the most successful alive. Native to western North America, house finches weren’t introduced to the East Coast until 1939, when a Brooklyn pet shop released a small number that had been illegally trapped in California. Over the next 50 years, these plucky pioneers established a firm footing, spreading across the continent until they reunited with their western cousins on the Great Plains. Today the finches inhabit perhaps the widest ecological range of any living bird, having emigrated from their ancestral deserts all the way to the edges of the subarctic taiga, adapting to suburbs and cities alike.\\nThough such a common species might not excite a seasoned backyard birder, I hardly qualified as such. I’d always liked birds, but I didn’t know a brown booby from a tufted titmouse. Only in writing about the aquarium hobby—an invention of the Victorian era, whose amateur naturalists spawned modern biology—had I come to recognize my own faunal illiteracy. I’d grown up in a time when courses such as ornithology and ichthyology had fallen out of favor, supplanted by the study of cells and DNA. While I’d never experienced the urge to keep a fish in a tank myself, I could understand the desire to draw nature close—even into one’s room.\\nAccording to experts, feeding birds is probably the most common way in which people interact with wild animals today. More than 50 million Americans engage in the practice, collectively undertaking an unwitting experiment on a vast scale. Is what we’re doing good or bad for birds? Recently, researchers at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology sought to answer this question, analyzing nearly three decades’ worth of data from a winter-long survey called Project FeederWatch. Preliminary results suggest the species visiting our feeders the most are faring exceptionally well in an age when one-third of the continent’s birds need urgent conservation. Still, what are the consequences of skewing the odds in favor of the small subset of species inclined to eat at feeders? What about when the bird we’re aiding is invasive, like our house finch? Three or four times a day, my heart thrilled at his arrival, announced with a polite, question-like cheep. He’d alight on the ledge outside my window, stand on his tiptoes, and strain his neck to peek inside like a finger puppet on the hand of some unhinged window washer. If I held still enough, he’d materialize in the feeder swiftly and daintily, only to begin eating with all the grace of a toddler, seed flying everywhere, sunflower husks spilling from his chomping beak. Traditional wisdom dictates that birds don’t become dependent on a free lunch. The idea traces to the mid-1980s when the wildlife ecologist Stanley Temple and his then-student Margaret Brittingham color-banded several hundred black-capped chickadees in the Wisconsin woods, mounted two specially designed feeders, then laboriously counted the sunflower seeds each bird ate. To the scientists’ astonishment, the chickadees obtained only 21 percent of their daily energy requirements from the feeders. The findings suggest that birds haven’t evolved to rely on a single ephemeral food source; rather, they’re constantly sampling the environment, forever scanning for backup options in a changeable world.\\nWhen Temple and Brittingham removed a feeder that had been stocked for more than 25 years from one of their study sites—a nature center at Devil’s Lake State Park—the chickadees there fared as well through the winter as those in the remote reaches of the reserve, where birds had never even seen a feeder. In other words, birds don’t forget how to forage just because they’re receiving handouts. Only in especially severe weather did feeders appear to undoubtedly help: chickadees with access to one had nearly double the chance of surviving the harsh Wisconsin winter—the difference coming down to a few frigid days. Before long, our resident male brought home a dull brown female to whom, at dawn, he sang an ebullient warbling tune that pierced the pillows over our heads. One morning, after a particularly passionate serenade, Jeff noticed the female tweeting up a storm in the feeder as she tilted her head and shimmied her wings. He called me over in time to see the male respond by leaning down to touch her beak and regurgitate down her throat. I had never seen something more beautiful. “I think I’m going to pass out,” I said, overcome with elation. Jeff seemed to think this was a little much. But he was growing attached to the finches too, and now the prospect of babies loomed. I confirmed that what we’d seen was indeed a courtship ritual, so when the female disappeared for a few weeks, I hoped she was off nesting in a nice drainage pipe somewhere. (I’d briefly entertained the fantasy that she’d lay her eggs in the feeder until I considered the hazards of fledging from the 25th floor. To say nothing of the red-tailed hawks that occasionally cruised by, known to live on New York University’s nearby Bobst Library.)\\nStudies suggest that birds receiving supplemental food may have a better shot at reproductive success, laying more eggs, for example, earlier in the year. Sure enough, one sunny April afternoon, incessant squawking interrupted my work. When the source of this ruckus clambered into the feeder, I found myself staring back at a bewildered fledgling with downy white pinfeathers sticking up from its head. Eventually, five of these clueless youngsters squeezed inside, making an awful racket and harassing their father for food he couldn’t consume and disgorge fast enough. It was an appalling vision of parenthood—and one that bore repeating in a matter of weeks.\\nSince house finches lay up to seven eggs in a clutch, and raise several broods a season, flocks may congregate by the hundreds. Soon, birds lined up on our ledge like patrons outside a hot new restaurant. Word spread through the finch population of Manhattan. By midsummer, the line zigzagged across the eastern face of our building. The raucous crowd attracted a few curious hangers-on: a dark-eyed junco, the Darth Vader of sparrows, his eyes obscured in an all-black helmet of a head; a mourning dove I called Lola, who monopolized the feeder for hours on end, vacuuming seed into an esophageal pouch called a crop for later digestion; and one warm summer evening, as twilight fell over the city, something large and fluffy that perched in silhouette against the darkening sky. Jeff swore it was a chicken. I feared it was a hawk. Should we feed birds? By doing so, we’re almost certainly changing them. Mostly, however, we got finches, all day, every day. Such clustering around feeders can accelerate the spread of disease. So I shouldn’t have been shocked when I strode by the window one August morning, causing the birds to scatter as usual, except one—a mussy-looking male who seemed oblivious to my presence. On closer inspection, I saw that his eyes were pink and swollen, encrusted with dried ooze. He hadn’t seen me because he was nearly blind. I’d been dreading this moment, hoping it wouldn’t arrive, and now I felt nauseous. More than two decades since conjunctivitis first began showing up in house finches, the disease continues to afflict the species, rendering the eastern population less than half its former size. To protect the flock, I knew I was supposed to shoo away the sick bird, though he could starve on his own.\\nI stood watching the finch peck lethargically at the seed. Then, tears in my eyes, I began to bang on the plexiglass until he stumbled dizzily out onto the ledge. Following recommended protocol, I removed the feeder, cleaned it with bleach, and closed up shop for two weeks to disperse the colony, lowering the shades against the throng at the window whose plaintive chirping I did my best to ignore. To my surprise, however, when the quarantine expired, the birds were there, awaiting the grand reopening. I didn’t see any more eye disease, but as summer passed and the weather grew colder, I began to worry about desert natives wintering in New York. I ordered a tiny space heater designed for pet parrots and got Jeff to wire it into the feeder. A few weeks later, on a snowy Saturday, I sat watching with satisfaction as a berry-red finch, puffed up against the cold, stood basking in the electric warmth, inhaling his breakfast. No sooner had I turned my head to bite into my own bagel then a sudden thud and flurry of flapping propelled me from my chair. I raced over to the feeder, where all that remained was a sad swirl of downy brown feathers, red only at the tips—and a single hawk quill. “Maybe the little guy survived,” Jeff said, stricken, when he returned from the gym and examined the forensic evidence. I wasn’t so sure and felt culpable for luring the hawk to a veritable vending machine of finches. How much did the classic studies tell us about birds eking out an existence on the mean streets of Greenwich Village? Predators in the apartment seemed like a turning point. I had to acknowledge that the feeder had become a major distraction. House finches are known to exhibit mild “feeder aggression,” and fights were constantly breaking out, dueling males tumbling by the window in cartoonish pinwheels. In lieu of actual food, our cupboards were stuffed with 16-pound bags of birdseed that we lugged up from the mail room all too frequently. At least every other week, I had to remove the feeder to scrub it with bleach and scrape off our ledges caked solid with bird poop. From the street below, it was nearly impossible to figure out what was attracting the finches to the building. Nevertheless, when my downstairs neighbor—who’d complained in the past about my clunky footsteps and propensity for dropping loose change—asked if I was seeing “exotic” red birds, I sheepishly came clean and waited for a cease-and-desist letter that surprisingly never arrived.\\nIn truth, I would’ve welcomed an easy out. I wanted to take down the feeder myself but felt responsible for the finches. If the classic studies on rural chickadees found they didn’t become dependent on feeders, how much did that tell us about birds eking out an existence on the mean streets of Greenwich Village? The question is more relevant today than ever before, in an age when half the human population now resides in cities for the first time in history, a proportion that’s rapidly on the rise. Over the coming decades, the future of many wild animals will depend on their ability to adapt to an increasingly urbanized world. At the library, I searched out a book called Avian Urban Ecology, which said that little is known about the impact of feeding most birds in cities. There is, however, one stunning exception. When I tried to contact the study’s author, Alexander Badyaev, I learned he was off the grid, trekking through the mountains of north-central Montana. He was doing what he’s done for 25 years: chasing house finches—in this case, populations isolated in valleys along the Continental Divide. In this region, house finches are relative newcomers, invaders from two separate fronts: those from the East, introduced via New York in the middle of the last century, and Western natives, which have undertaken a dramatic and unexplained dispersal within roughly the same time frame. “For some reason, the finches just decided to take over the world,” Badyaev told me when we finally spoke several weeks later, noting that the species has also spread south, pushing deep into the tropics of Mexico. Though the reasons for this continent-wide colonization remain mysterious, its well-documented and recent nature—knowing who derives from whom and when—presents a rare opportunity to watch the stages of evolution in the wild and observe how past adaptations affect future ones. If Darwin saw his theory of natural selection illuminated in the finches of the Galapagos, Badyaev is looking deep into the house finch to resolve a question he feels Darwin never answered: How does life maintain evolvability, the facility to change and adapt to the future?\\nIn the Southwest, for example, where Badyaev is a professor at the University of Arizona, house finches live on their native turf and nest on the cholla cactus, females shielding eggs against temperatures hot enough to hard-boil them. Meanwhile, some thousand miles to the north, where Badyaev earned his doctorate at the University of Montana, the same species hatches its young under snow cover, having undergone a transformation involving everything from hormonal signaling to eggshell architecture. To understand such radical metamorphoses, executed over a few short decades, his team has been measuring nearly every conceivable metric in hundreds of thousands of banded finches across dozens of populations, yielding one of the largest studies of wild birds in the world. There’s such a thing as a finch Brooklyn accent—thanks to feeders like mine. So when one of Badyaev’s undergraduate students, Clayton Addison, noticed that the male finches on campus in central Tucson were not singing a rapid trill that’s essential for attracting females in the nearby desert, the lab was able to dig into the data for answers. Comparing the beak sizes, bite forces, and diets of the two populations, the researchers showed that the urban finches rely so heavily on feeders that their beaks have adapted: they’ve become longer and deeper to accommodate the sunflower seeds typically on offer, which are much larger and harder than the small cactus and grass seeds that rural finches eat. This adaptation has altered not only how urban males sing, but also what urban females prefer in a mate. It’s a pattern that Badyaev has since found in other places where finches live in the shadow of humans, the same large beaks arising from a surprisingly diverse array of developmental pathways. Such varied routes to an identical end—a beak strong enough to crack sunflower seeds—may be one way that nature hides variability from the swinging axe of natural selection.\\nEvolutionary theory aside, however, I was stuck on one point: There’s such a thing as a finch Brooklyn accent—thanks to feeders like mine. So should we feed birds? By doing so, we’re almost certainly changing them. A recent study in Science found that the beaks of great tits have evolved to be longer in the United Kingdom than in continental Europe, possibly due to the popularity of feeders in England. What’s more, species from hummingbirds to northern cardinals are wintering farther north than they have in the past, though whether as a consequence of feeders, the warming climate, or both remains a largely open question. (To say nothing of the garbage and waste grain from agriculture that we feed many birds without intending to.) Precisely because we’re altering nature so radically and in so many ways, bird feeders are bound to seem comparatively innocuous. Meanwhile, proponents argue that they connect us to wildlife, opening our eyes to the world beyond our backyards, including those species most in need of our help, such as seabirds and tropical birds. Just after Christmas, Jeff planned a short trip to Panama and, in a move entirely out of character, surprised me with a birding tour—something he stipulated he was willing to do exactly once in his life. Early in the new year, we rose at 4 a.m. and stood yawning in the steamy darkness outside our hotel, waiting for a guide named Justo, who turned out to be the khaki-clad young man staring straight past us.', 'NYC Dive Bar Says It Will Kick Out Anyone Who Uses the Word \\'Literally\\'\\nThis is, like, literally discrimination.\\nPhoto via Twitter user EVGrieve\\nThe Continental , a divey mainstay of Manhattan’s East Village neighborhood since 1991, will be shutting its doors for good on July 1 of this year. As it slouches towards extinction, though, it’s certainly going out with a bang. If you’re lucky enough to get past the bouncers and through the doors of a place that’s made headlines for banning people with saggy pants and has a whole page on its official website dedicated to its “DISCRIMINATORY DOOR POLICY?” , you better watch your dumb mouth and not get too loose with the word “literally.”\\nA sign posted on the bar’s facade, EV Grieve reported last Wednesday after a reader alerted the publication to it the day prior, warned patrons against using the word “literally” for any reason once they’re inside the bar. If you’re caught using that word, the sign warns, you’ll have five minutes to suck down your drink and leave the bar.\\n\"Sorry but if you say the word \\'literally\\' inside the Continental you have 5 minutes to finish your drink and then you must leave,\" the sign reads. \"If you actually start a sentence with \\'I literally\\' you must leave immediately!!!\"\\nWow! OK! I heard you!\\nThe sign’s stated justification for enforcing this punitive policy is that the word is the \"most overused, annoying word in the English language.\" By last Thursday, EV Grieve reported, an updated version of the sign was posted with a line that clarified the stance somewhat: “Stop Kardashianism now!”\\nIt’s no news that “literally” is perhaps the most fraught adverb of all time, a fact that’s been established well before the Kardashian era. It’s annoyed a number of linguistic purists who’re peeved by how the word is misused casually and recklessly in place of its cousin “figuratively,” sprinkling sentences where it doesn’t belong.\\nThe bar’s owner, Trigger Smith, could not be reached for immediate comment by MUNCHIES on Thursday, though he told Grub Street on Wednesday that this sign was meant in jest. He expressed confusion as to why the reaction to the sign on social wasn’t exactly too peachy, taking umbrage, in particular, with the accusation that his policy has a whiff of sexism . He finds this critique baseless.\\n“Anybody who knows me knows I’m a feminist who supports women’s rights and is 100 percent behind this whole ‘Me Too’ thing,” he told Grub Street. “I guess people will find an issue in anything.”\\nEr, OK. Anyway, the Continental happens to be in a neighborhood that’s teeming with over a dozen other options for getting hammered, so if you\\'re really desperate to pepper your sentences with the L-word, you can always go to literally any other bar that won’t police your language so hawkishly. (Sorry.)', 'Stuart V. Goldberg\\nKevin Penczak / Assistant: Snakebite\\nIn a half hour Stuart V. Goldberg needs to be in three different Chicago courtrooms dozens of miles apart. It\\'s 8:30 AM on a Tuesday in October 2016. He takes off the jacket of his gray, three-piece Tom Ford suit before sliding behind the wheel of his white Rolls-Royce. He is a man of many mantras and rituals. \"If you don\\'t take your coat off while you drive you\\'re like the hundred other lawyers in court with a wrinkled suit,\" he says. Goldberg is widely known in local legal circles as one of the city\\'s busiest criminal defense attorneys. He swings by to pick up his nephew Matthew Kaplan, then a student at Goldberg\\'s alma mater, John Marshall Law School. The 27-year-old will drive his uncle from court to court, semireclined behind the wheel, assisting him in preparing arguments and drafting motions throughout the day. Goldberg gets on speakerphone. \"Linda, you\\'re doing a great job!\" he announces earnestly to the courtroom clerk who picks up. \"Running a little late.\" He asks her to push his case to a later slot on the morning\\'s docket. \"R.J., what\\'s up, it\\'s Goldberg,\" he says to the next clerk on his speed dial. \"Just pass it for me.\" Whichever judge he knows to be the strictest about starting hearings on time, it\\'s his or her courtroom he heads to first. No sooner does Goldberg walk through the doors of a courthouse than people begin approaching to ask for his card. (\"They\\'re hand engraved,\" he likes to point out. He estimates that he\\'s handed out a quarter million of them over the years.) Guards, other lawyers, and judges greet him as he floats by, back straight, leading with his chest. No matter how short he is on time, he never looks rushed. \"The way I dress, the way I act, the way I walk into a courtroom is all part of the brand,\" Goldberg later tells me. Entering a courtroom in Pullman on the city\\'s far south side, Goldberg—a dead ringer for Michael Douglas in Beyond a Reasonable Doubt, with his silver mane and angular features—struts past rows of pews filled with mostly black men, women, and children, and then two filled with mostly white cops. He shakes hands with one of the officers, then goes to talk with his client\\'s girlfriend. Her boyfriend, Llewain Hardin, was out on bail on a different drug case when he was arrested with 41 small bags of crack cocaine and 13 baggies of heroin—enough to land him a few years in prison if he were convicted. Llewain was supposed to lay low while Goldberg worked to resolve his other case, but \"he didn\\'t listen to me,\" Goldberg says. \"The drugs were found on him.\" At the preliminary hearing today the judge would decide whether there was probable cause to suspect that Llewain committed the felony and if so, send the case on to be prosecuted before the same judge who was hearing the first case. This would make defending Llewain on both sets of charges harder. \"The officer was an honest officer. He wrote a good report,\" Goldberg notes, scanning the arrest report for red flags and inconsistencies. In the margins he\\'d scribbled some notes in purple ink. When Llewain, a tall black man with dreadlocks, is brought into the courtroom from lockup in a beige jumpsuit, the same police officer who\\'d shaken Goldberg\\'s hand approaches the judge\\'s bench. The prosecutor, a young white woman, questions him about the arrest. He testifies that a call had come in about a drug dealer, and when he arrived on the scene he saw Llewain sitting on a stoop. As he approached he says he saw \"a bulge\" in Llewain\\'s waistband and proceeded to frisk him, thinking it could be a gun. The bulge turned out to be a package of drugs wrapped in individual doses seemingly ready for sale. On cross-examination of the officer, Goldberg focuses on the details. Despite his flashy appearance there\\'s no bombast; in and out of court Goldberg is soft-spoken, patient, and methodical. He questions the cop about what the 911 caller had reported—drug sales in progress—and what the officer saw when he arrived on the scene—a man loosely matching the caller\\'s description sitting on a stoop. Goldberg asks about the bulge that looked like a gun. The officer says that during the pat down he felt it was \"soft.\" Goldberg zeroes in. During a preliminary hearing, attorneys are not supposed to argue about the evidence for charges, only about the grounds for arrest, and so the prosecutor quickly objects when Goldberg turns to the judge and cites Minnesota v. Dickerson. But the judge looks interested and lets Goldberg keep talking. This was a 1993 Supreme Court decision stating that if a police officer is frisking a suspect for weapons and feels an object that he knows isn\\'t a weapon but can\\'t tell what that object is, then continuing the search and seizing the object is unconstitutional, even if it turns out to be contraband. The moment the cop felt that the bulge in Llewain\\'s waistband was soft, he knew it wasn\\'t a gun and had to stop the search, Goldberg argues. \"We\\'re hoping for judicial economy,\" he concludes—a signal to the judge that the case would fall apart later since the evidence couldn\\'t be used against Llewain anyway and that it would be pointless to let the arrest stand and tie up the next judge\\'s docket. The judge agrees. \"There is a finding of no probable cause,\" he says and calls the next case. Spinning around toward her colleagues, the Cook County assistant state\\'s attorney mouths \"I can\\'t believe it!\" with eyes bulging. Llewain grins as a sheriff\\'s deputy leads him out of the courtroom. He\\'ll be released later that afternoon. “The way I dress, the way I act, the way I walk into a courtroom is all part of the brand.” —Stuart V. Goldberg \"That was near impossible,\" Goldberg tells Llewain\\'s girlfriend as he makes his way out of the courtroom. Before he reaches the door two more people ask for his card. As he entered his 70s, Goldberg\\'s career was on fire: up to a dozen courtroom appearances for different clients every day, three bench trials every week, a jury trial once a month. After every win in court—whether a not-guilty verdict, a successful motion to suppress illegally obtained evidence that gets his client\\'s case dismissed, or a finding of no probable cause for arrest—Goldberg posted a celebratory picture of himself with his happy clients on Instagram and Facebook. Below, dozens of followers and friends left notes of gratitude, words of congratulations, and pleas to represent them. Like Saul Goodman, the fictional lawyer who helped Walter White get out of many a legal pickle in Breaking Bad, Goldberg has a knack for making cases disappear, and it\\'s earned him a loyal clientele among Chicagoans living at the intersection of crime and police overreach. Caught with two pounds of marijuana? Better call Stu. Cops seized three assault rifles from your home? Better call Stu. Pulled over by police and charged with a DUI for that cough syrup in your cup holder? Better call Stu. (But when you call, you better not call him Stu—it\\'s Stuart.) Regardless of what crimes his clients—most of them young, black men—may or may not have committed on the streets, in Chicago, and across the country, they\\'re usually treated by cops, prosecutors, and judges as guilty until proven innocent. They\\'re usually poor and represented by overburdened public defenders. If they have the money to get a lawyer they\\'re more likely to wind up with a shark. Their constitutional protections against unreasonable arrest and unwarranted search and seizure as well as their right to a speedy trial are rarely affirmed. According to a report from the Cook County state’s attorney’s office, 57 percent of black defendants in the county found guilty of a felony in 2016 were sentenced to prison time, compared to 36 percent of white and 39 percent of Latino defendants, who were more likely to get probation. Of the 11,000 people sent to Illinois prisons from Cook County in 2016, 74 percent were black. In this moment, Goldberg—with his virtuosity in oral arguments, encyclopedic knowledge of the law, and categorical refusal to consider plea bargains in all but the most extreme circumstances—is exactly the kind of champion they need in court. But the man who\\'s been reversing their odds case by case isn\\'t on a social justice crusade to undo the policies that produce his client base. He sees himself as a foot soldier in the battle between good and evil—humanity\\'s noble intentions and our tendency to make bad decisions, ordinary people\\'s attempts to keep their heads above water and the government\\'s incessant drive to limit their options for doing so. It\\'s a battle that\\'s cost him friends, family, money, and even for a time, his career. Surviving a lifetime of snatching people from the jaws of the justice system has required a knack for reinvention and a thick, protective armor.\\nOn Instagram and Facebook, Goldberg often posts celebratory pictures of himself with his happy clients.\\nVia @goldbergcriminaldefense\\nGoldberg exits the courthouse just as Matthew pulls around in the Rolls. He drops his white Hermès briefcase in the trunk and snaps the lid shut. The license plate reads SNKCHMR—snake charmer. It\\'s how he\\'s come to think of himself, as a tamer of the \"evil forces at 26th and California that will push you into trouble.\" He\\'s come a long way from his working-class upbringing in West Rogers Park. Neither of his parents, children of Jewish eastern-European immigrants, went to college. His father didn\\'t finish high school. Goldberg was the eldest child and only son; his three younger sisters, he says, set him up to be a \"woman\\'s man, not a man\\'s man.\" He never watched or participated in sports; his favorite pastime has always been \"a one-on-one conversation.\" He describes himself as a short kid, \"definitely a late bloomer,\" who allied with the biggest, toughest kids in grammar school to protect himself from bullies. He got in trouble a lot. Teachers regularly sent notes home: \"Does not play well with others.\" \"Doesn\\'t come organized.\" \"Talks unnecessarily.\" Though he wasn\\'t a particularly good student, Goldberg had a fierce competitive streak and sought out leadership roles, like being hall monitor \"lieutenant,\" which entitled him to a badge with three stars and authority over others. \"When I was in a group, I wanted to be the top of the group,\" he says. By the time he got to college at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the late 60s, he was already thinking about a career in law. Goldberg recalls Madison resembling a war zone: mass protests against the Vietnam war, activists bombing buildings, police in riot gear hurtling tear gas. But he was utterly uninterested in politics and resented the protesters disrupting the functioning of the university. \"I just wanted to get to law school,\" he says \"I did originally lean a little bit toward law and order.\" Drug use was also rampant. \"They thought I was some kind of undercover narc in Wisconsin because I was so straight,\" Goldberg says. He didn\\'t use, smoke, or drink—still doesn\\'t—having grown up in a home where alcohol was only around on Passover, when drinking the sugary wine \"was like tasting piss.\" (There\\'s a nonalcoholic cocktail called the SVG at one of his favorite stops, Le Colonial, the upscale Vietnamese restaurant in the Gold Coast. A bartender created it to match the lawyer\\'s orange Lamborghini: lychee puree, mango juice, sour mix. Patrons can choose to add vodka.) In his last year of college Goldberg was drafted. Months before his deployment to Vietnam, a congenital defect spared him: he was born with two kidneys on one side of his body, a condition known as fused renal ectopia. Because he thought he\\'d be deployed, Goldberg didn\\'t apply to law school during his senior year at Madison. After graduation he returned to Chicago and began looking for work. He was hired as a Chicago Public Schools substitute teacher. At first he was sent all over the district, until one day he landed at Walter Scott, a grammar school on Blackstone Avenue in Woodlawn, where a teacher had left abruptly. The largely black school was understaffed and overcrowded. Many students had special needs, Goldberg recalls, but no special attention. He was assigned to a class of students who were behind on their reading skills. “I’m like a surgeon. They roll them in on a stretcher. I don\\'t ask was it the cop, the bank robber, or the teller that got shot, I just take the bullet out. I do my job as a crucial part of the way the justice system works.” —Stuart V. Goldberg \"They were ten, 11, 12, and they were my size,\" Goldberg says. \"They beat up the last teacher and stole his car.\" He told me he felt for them but he was also overwhelmed by their behavioral problems. Almost immediately he had to send kids to the principal for fighting or refusing to work. But when they returned to class he was horrified to learn they\\'d been beaten; back then staff at CPS schools got away with corporal punishment. \"The principals in the elementary schools in the inner city would have rulers taped together, or pointers, and they would whip the kids.\" Goldberg decided he wouldn\\'t send the kids away anymore, instead inventing new rules for his classroom: he let them chew gum, created a point system to incentivize good behavior, and handed out prizes. By the week\\'s end, he says, the students were begging him to stay on. \"The kids signed a petition, and the parents, to have me come back. And sent it to the Board of Education.\" Goldberg ended up spending a year at Walter Scott. He says his students\\' behavior continued to improve as he positively reinforced them, and though he\\'d had no formal training as an educator, he was able to teach them reading basics. He played music on Fridays, letting boys and girls dance with each other. He took them riding in his car and out to eat lunch. \"It was so rewarding. It was unbelievable,\" he says. \"I got these kids to see that there was some other life. Every day I broke up a fight. I sewed their shirts together. Because if they went home with a ripped shirt, they would get beaten.\" He says students eventually started calling him Daddy Goldberg. As the law school application cycle approached, Goldberg considered staying in teaching, but given \"the difference I could make just as a teacher—my God, what difference could I make as their lawyer?\" he recalls thinking. \"I would be in charge of their lives. I could save them. When they stepped off that rock, I could save them.\" Goldberg finally walked into John Marshall Law School in the fall of 1970. He met a real lawyer for the first time that day at orientation. The next year Richard Nixon declared drugs \"public enemy number one,\" and as Goldberg immersed himself in his studies and drove a cab at night to pay his way, he began to see drugs as the base of a fledgling specialization. \"It was my feeling that, in criminal law, drugs were the catalyst—the common denominator in most criminal cases,\" he says. He also had some personal experience with the criminal element around drugs: one night in Evanston a couple of dazed hippies held him at gunpoint, and he found himself having to negotiate the surrender of his day\\'s cab fare earnings. Illinois appellate court justice Aurelia Pucinski remembers meeting Goldberg at John Marshall in 1973, as he was preparing to graduate. He sat next to her on her first day of class, and \"I thought, OK, he\\'s a really hot guy.\" But then Pucinski recalls Goldberg turning to her and asking, \"Do you have a game plan?\" \"I said, \\'Well . . . what\\'s yours?\\'\" He announced that he planned to \"get a job at the DEA,\" where he\\'d learn how they investigated and built cases against drug dealers. And then, he concluded to the young future judge, \"I\\'m gonna go out and represent the biggest drug kingpin in America and I\\'m gonna be a millionaire.\" Pucinski was impressed. She saw Goldberg a few more times before he graduated and then again periodically over the years. \"Stuart Goldberg is living proof that having a game plan works,\" she says every time she tells this story, which is often, mostly to young people. \"That was 1973 and I\\'m still talking about it all these years later. He\\'s a guy who knew what he had to do to get to where he wanted to be. So God bless.\" Goldberg didn\\'t end up at the DEA. Instead his first job was with the Illinois Drug Abuse Program; he was an attorney for a network of state-funded rehab centers where people charged with drug possession could be sentenced as an alternative to incarceration. Less than a year after he entered that line of work, he saw that there was a huge client base among the participants and left to start his own private practice. Besides, he didn\\'t like having a boss. But being your own boss didn\\'t mean being in charge of your professional life. What he quickly learned was that in the mid-70s, Cook County criminal courtrooms were a cesspool of corruption.\\nGoldberg says there are five things to look for in a man—shoes, haircut, pen, tie, and watch.\\nKevin Penczak\\nAs the Rolls glides north on the Dan Ryan Expressway, past some of the most impoverished neighborhoods in the city, Goldberg is still reveling in the improbable victory he orchestrated for Llewain. I ask him whether he thinks Llewain will heed his advice now and stop selling drugs while his other case is pending. \"No,\" Goldberg says without hesitation. \"He\\'s got a girlfriend that works hard, a hardworking girl that loves him. He\\'s got children. I think it\\'s weakness, stupidity, and ignorance, and an easy way to make a living, and that\\'s probably all he knows.\" Goldberg doesn\\'t bring up the fact that Llewain\\'s previous felony conviction would prevent him from getting most any legitimate job, though when the point is raised he agrees that it\\'s true. Unlike criminal justice reform crusaders, Goldberg isn\\'t prone to holding forth about bias and racism in the system, or the way that people\\'s entrapment in it is determined by race and socioeconomic status. He says he\\'s always identified with black clients because he understands what it\\'s like to be an outsider—he\\'s been the only Jew in many a room. But asked whether he thinks there\\'s racial discrimination in the courts he seems to contemplate the notion as if he\\'d never before given it a thought. \"Somewhat,\" he concedes finally. Goldberg says he loves cops and respects prosecutors even though his job puts him in direct opposition to them in the courtroom. A self-identified Republican, he\\'s pro-Second Amendment and disdains big government, and also thinks marijuana should be legalized. When he talks about his clients he\\'s neither particularly sympathetic nor especially judgmental. \"I\\'m not saying he\\'s an honorable, perfect representation of a citizen of Chicago,\" Goldberg says of Llewain, \"but if we are to operate under our law, I\\'m like a surgeon. They roll them in on a stretcher, I don\\'t ask was it the cop, the bank robber, or the teller that got shot, I just take the bullet out. I do my job as a crucial part of the way the justice system works.\" Ultimately Goldberg\\'s outlook is that life isn\\'t deterministic. He believes in the importance of personal choices, and in everyone\\'s propensity to make bad ones. \"We\\'re in the business of man\\'s inhumanity to man,\" he likes to say of his work. \"We\\'re in the mistake business.\" As long as they can afford it, Goldberg\\'s clients—the majority of whom are facing drug and weapons-related charges and come from neighborhoods besieged by aggressive policing and gun violence—can count on the second chances to keep coming. Some of his clients are ordinary people who might get pulled over driving someone else\\'s car in which the cops discover a gun. Many face low-level pot possession charges. But some of his clients appear, based on the charges against them, to be deeply connected with criminal enterprises. Goldberg considers the day\\'s schedule and listens to some voice mails. The only way to reach him is by phone. He doesn\\'t use e-mail because, he says, \"e-mail is for pornographers.\" Though his business card lists an address on the 14th floor of a swanky Magnificent Mile building, Goldberg only occasionally shows up there to make use of a conference room. \"Offices,\" he says, \"are for guys sitting around waiting for the phone to ring.\" His cars serve as both office and billboard—the ultimate marker of success and professionalism. The Rolls is always showroom clean. When excited young men run up to ask how much it costs, he likes to answer \"a lot of not-guiltys.\" Inside there\\'s not a single personal object in sight. In the trunk he keeps only purple manila folders that hold his clients\\' files and an Alexander McQueen umbrella with a skull handle. There are also a couple of small trays for the times he and Matthew get Portillo\\'s on the go; with around 50 cases each week scattered across the county, that\\'s not unusual. \"One of my most important client\\'s son is up today,\" Goldberg says. Kolby Craig, known to everyone as Big Mo, \"has referred innumerable people to me. Hundreds.\" Goldberg explains that in addition to beating Mo\\'s charges on many occasions, he also \"saved [Mo\\'s] best friend\\'s life. He had a kilo of cocaine in his lap.\" Mo has generously repaid Goldberg\\'s services not only in tens of thousands of dollars in fees but in more personal ways as well. \"When my son was born he went to a jeweler and had a tiny Jewish star made, all with diamonds.\" Mo\\'s son\\'s case appears to be a formidable challenge. In March 2016, 18-year-old Stephon Mack was indicted on one count of possession of a controlled substance, four counts of armed violence, and 24 counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. Goldberg managed to get Stephon out on house arrest, but he still has to prove the guns and drugs can\\'t be used as evidence against the teen. As he scans the police reports again, Goldberg is unequivocal. \"A clear case of the cops lying,\" he says.\\nGoldberg circa mid-70s with a 1974 De Tomaso Pantera.

Goldberg\\nThe moment in Stuart Goldberg\\'s personal narrative in which it becomes hard to parse what\\'s real and what\\'s embellished is the mid-1970s. At that time judges in almost every division of the circuit court of Cook County were taking bribes to fix cases. Traffic tickets, divorces, drug charges—all could go away at the right price. When he talks about this part of his life, Goldberg begins by saying, \"Now I\\'m getting into The Snake Charmer.\" This is the title of the autobiographical novel he\\'s been working on for more than 20 years. It\\'s his dream to see it made into a movie. Sitting at the Greek Islands on Halsted Street—another restaurant where everyone knows his name—he frequently distinguishes between events happening \"in real life\" or \"in The Snake Charmer.\" Goldberg says that when he began his private practice he saw the scales of justice being tipped, and it outraged him. What\\'s more, the heavily Irish Catholic judiciary\\'s anti-Semitic hostility toward him was palpable, he says. \"The whole system was ridiculously corrupt. You had to give money to the clerk to get your cases called. If you weren\\'t in the club of people paying off the sheriffs, the cops, the judges, it was very difficult to break in.\" Even in his custom-made black three-piece suit and leather cowboy boots he says he felt invisible, waiting all day in narcotics courtrooms for his turn in front of the judge. \"The way it worked was, you walked up to the clerk and you had $10 in your hand. The clerk would open the drawer or the clerk would push the wastebasket out, and you dropped it in the basket or the drawer, and your case was called.\" The sheriff\\'s deputies would also make a cut by directing confused defendants to attorneys who played ball. Was he ever tempted to participate? \"No, that\\'s not my style,\" Goldberg says. \"I\\'m too much of a rebel.\" During one of our conversations about The Snake Charmer, he quotes a favorite passage from the book inspired by his experience with courtroom corruption: \"Is it bribery when you pay a judge, to give money for the person you\\'re representing to get off? Or is it extortion when you can\\'t represent them unless you pay money?\" By the late 70s the circuit court was the target of a massive undercover FBI investigation code-named Operation Greylord—the largest judicial corruption sting in American history, which involved the wiretapping of judges\\' chambers and undercover operatives paying to fix cases. Sources close to the operation say that Goldberg wasn\\'t involved with the federal efforts to bring down the judges, and no one I spoke with had heard of Goldberg being one of the corrupt lawyers who was targeted by the investigation. Still, in his recollection he was close to the action in the Greylord years. Goldberg says that as his struggle to get his clients\\' cases called continued, he began to take notes in his agenda book. \"The bottom of every page, I started keeping a diary: this attorney fixed this case, this judge did this.\" Later, when everyone learned that prosecutor Terry Hake was an undercover FBI operative wearing a wire and collecting evidence on dirty lawyers and judges, Goldberg felt honored that Hake had never approached him with an offer to fix a case. Goldberg says his notekeeping, though, created an \"unknown symbiotic relationship\" between him and Hake: \"He was fixing cases, I was documenting what he was doing.\" (Hake, whose book Operation Greylord: The True Story of an Untrained Undercover Agent and America\\'s Biggest Corruption Bust was published in 2015, declined to comment for this story.) Despite the difficulties he faced being a clean lawyer in a dirty system, Goldberg\\'s practice eventually flourished. He bought a Gold Coast condo and a Ferrari, and in 1980 married a beautiful blond woman ten years his junior after just three months of dating. His daughter was born the next year, but he says it was an unhappy marriage. \"During the night I fought her and during the days I fought the court.\" Goldberg says that at one point his wife and her attorney copied his lawyer\\'s diary and turned over all the information to the IRS. The goal, he believes, was to use his financial information for leverage in the divorce, which she filed for in 1983. Six weeks later, as he lay sleeping in his empty condo, Goldberg says he got a knock on the door. \"She had taken the baby. She had taken her fur coat. She had taken everything. My mattress is on the floor,\" he recalls. \"I look out the peephole and I see every gold badge in the United States government—FBI, DEA, IRS, Secret Service—and an assistant United States attorney.\" (Robert Breisblatt, who was an assistant U.S. attorney at the time, recalls showing up to the door with only two FBI agents.) Goldberg says they were all there to pressure him to testify against crooked judges after the IRS saw his notes on who was taking bribes. \"They said, \\'Yeah, you\\'re the perfect witness—an honest attorney.\\'\" But he refused. \"They said, \\'We want your impressions.\\' I said, \\'My impressions will get me killed.\\' I didn\\'t help them.\" He claims that in retaliation the IRS audited his taxes for six years and he was threatened with arrest multiple times. Through the late 80s and early 90s, even without Goldberg\\'s testimony, more than 100 judges, lawyers, and court staff were indicted and convicted on federal corruption charges resulting from Operation Greylord. By that time he\\'d gotten close to fulfilling his law school game plan by becoming the go-to attorney for the middle managers in the organization of Mario Lloyd, one of the most notorious Chicago cocaine kingpins of the era, who\\'d gone from selling $1 joints to running a $30-million-a-year drug ring.\\nGoldberg with his son, Maximilian, and his Lamborghini in 2016\\nCourtesy Stuart V. Goldberg\\nAmong people familiar with Chicago\\'s criminal circles, Goldberg now enjoys a legendary reputation, not least because he\\'s a self-made man. Big Mo first met Goldberg in 2012 but had heard about him for many years before. \"Growing up in the hood, in the city, when you see them nice cars it\\'s what you want for yourself,\" Mo says of what makes Goldberg an attractive lawyer as he waits for his son\\'s case to be called at 26th and California. \"But then to meet the man behind the car or meet the man behind the myth and the legend—he was everything they said.\" Goldberg had prepared to argue a motion to suppress all the evidence in Stephon\\'s case. It was clear to him, after reading what he refers to as the \"mystical code\" of the police reports, that the warrantless search and seizure was done illegally and the drugs and guns—a couple of Glocks and a small, ultralightweight rifle—couldn\\'t be pinned on Stephon. Mo says there are plenty of lawyers who take your money but don\\'t fight. There are also plenty who just don\\'t have the necessary skill. Compared to them, \"Goldberg\\'s just in another league.\" Over the years, Goldberg and Big Mo became friends. Mo says he believes that even if he were dead broke Goldberg would take his cases. He\\'s been arrested for everything from weed possession to disorderly conduct to aggravated assault. Most of the time his charges were dropped or he\\'d plead guilty for a reduced sentence. But in 2015 Goldberg help him beat drug charges that could\\'ve landed him a 50-year prison sentence. Should he ever face federal charges, Mo is certain Goldberg would come out of retirement for him. \"He\\'s just been good to me and my family, that\\'s all,\" Mo says. To him, Goldberg represents a chance \"to beat the system for once. On a small scale.\" Though courtroom dramas would have us believe that every criminal trial is heard by a jury, the vast majority are actually resolved by a judge in a bench trial, if they get that far. Goldberg usually prefers to take a bench trial in which he prevails against prosecutors by arguing the law. (The assistant state\\'s attorneys used to have a \"win board\" in their office onto which they pinned the names and ties of prosecutors after their first jury trial victory. There was also a photo of Goldberg there, with a notice scrawled in red marker—\"WARNING: Avoid at all cost!\") He prefers a jury trial when the facts of the client\\'s case are relatable and he can make an emotional appeal. If he loses the motion and Stephon\\'s case goes to trial, Goldberg would opt for a jury because he thinks the only way he can lose is if judge Thomas V. Gainer is sympathetic to the officers whom he believes lied about where and how they found the guns. “To meet the man behind the car or meet the man behind the myth and the legend—he was everything they said.” —Kolby “Big Mo” Craig, Goldberg’s longtime client Even if he\\'s running late and doesn\\'t have a long history with a defendant, Goldberg goes out of his way to make the people who retain his services feel as if they\\'re his only clients. He makes emphatic eye contact, holds the client\\'s hand, explains his strategy in a way that\\'s clear and comprehensible. He never looks worried or unsure. That\\'s because, as Mo puts it, Goldberg\\'s already got \"the blueprint\" for how everything will go figured out as soon as he reads a police report. As Goldberg puts it, \"I try to imagine something I want in my mind and then create the circumstances.\" It\\'s how he says he approaches life outside the courtroom too. His own biggest second chance came three and a half years ago when he met 19-year-old Miranda Carranza, an aspiring model with dark, flowing hair who was wandering around River North looking for a Jimmy John\\'s. Goldberg was on his way to a steak dinner with clients. He had just self-published his first novel, The One and Only, about an antiques collector going after an impossible dream. \"I beckoned the universe. I was the loneliest person in the world. I had everything I always wanted—but it wasn\\'t enough.\" Goldberg stopped her as she was about to pass by and they began to talk. He asked about some words in Spanish on her shirt and then asked if she knew about the five things to look for in a man—shoes, haircut, pen, tie, watch. \"I wasn\\'t really listening, I was just watching him talk,\" Carranza told me in early November 2016. She\\'s from McHenry County and was on the verge of enlisting in the navy before moving to Chicago to pursue modeling instead. She says she was inexplicably drawn to Goldberg\\'s energy. \"It was the most magnetic feeling,\" she says, like she already knew him. He invited her to dinner. They spent the entire evening engrossed in conversation, ignoring the clients. She ate steak even though she was a vegan. In a few months\\' time they were married and had a son, Maximilian Pierceson Goldberg. Carranza says at first her parents were aghast at the May-December romance. But slowly she brought them around. \"I said there\\'s nothing really you can do about it. By legal definition I\\'m an adult, and I\\'m in love with him and you\\'re just gonna have to deal with that.\" At that time—late 2016—Goldberg didn\\'t have much of a life outside court and family. His wife, their baby son, his nephew, and his nonagenarian mother were his social world. He spent any leftover time working out at the East Bank Club (where he still entered 48 as his age on the elliptical). He read voraciously, and peppered conversation with references to Proust, Maimonides, Einstein, Nietzsche, Shakespeare, Carl Jung, W.C. Fields. He never talked about his daughter. Once, however, when discussing his own father he quoted from the Odyssey: \" \\'I am that father whom your boyhood lacked and suffered pain for lack of,\\' \" then added, pensively: \"I get to be a great father to Maximilian.\"\\nIn the mid-80s Goldberg was divorced and out for a good time. Business was booming, with plenty of work coming from Mario Lloyd\\'s organization and other referrals. With a sizable disposable income, he wasn\\'t about to get hammered and hook up with strangers at Rush Street bars like a mere mortal. Instead, he frequently hosted enormous themed parties in the nightclubs and hotel ballrooms of Lincoln Park. \"That\\'s when Oprah told me she wanted to marry me and have my baby,\" Goldberg recalls. A 1985 article about three eligible local bachelors in the Chicago Tribune captured the atmosphere at one of these events at the Park West, which attracted some 900 guests who paid admission: \"For this party, Goldberg had arranged for a choreographed ultra-chic fashion show, a sensuous body building routine and a karate act. Amid a cloud of smoke and a faded white light, a string of elegantly clad models struck poses with their backs to the audience. An Elvis look-alike modeled a rhinestone jacket just barely reaching his swiveling hips. In this fashion show, dance imitated life in the fast lane. An agile, blond male dressed like a penguin twirled, spun, jumped and did splits on roller skates to rock music. For the finale, Goldberg himself, keeping perfect step to the music, gyrated in a glittery silver sequined hand-sewn top.\" But being the lawyer for Lloyd\\'s street-level dealers and others implicated in drug and gun crimes wasn\\'t all parties and high fashion. Goldberg was losing clients and clients who\\'d become friends to street violence on a regular basis—his \"record,\" he says, was 12 clients dead in as many months in the mid-80s. \"I would just hug people on Friday and they would be dead on Saturday or Sunday,\" he recalls. By far the most painful loss was that of his law clerk Michael Nevels. He was a young black man Goldberg once defended on armed robbery charges. After winning the man\\'s case, Goldberg found him waxing his car. \"He would show up and go to court with me,\" Goldberg says. Though Nevels didn\\'t have any formal training in law, he offered insights from a lot of experiences as a defendant that Goldberg found useful. \"He was just a sweet guy who\\'d never hurt anybody,\" Goldberg says. \"But he had cases.\" After they\\'d worked together for four years, becoming close friends, Nevels died of AIDS. \"Use of needles,\" Goldberg says. He saw Nevels the way he sees many of his clients, a perspective he would later summarize in The Snake Charmer: \"No man is black or white. In the heart of the worst criminal, there\\'s a secret garden that is within the grasp of the fresh start of a not guilty.\" The years of working among so many corrupt officials and suddenly losing people he\\'d formed bonds with, and the painful saga of his brief marriage and protracted divorce reinforced his natural tendency to keep to himself. \"It was lonely,\" Goldberg admits. But he never lost faith in the idea that he was doing good and necessary work. He says he\\'s not conflicted about defending his clients, that the rush of giving someone a second chance combined with the righteous feeling of protecting citizens from government overreach keeps him going. \"If I can win using the legal means that I should, I\\'ve given [clients] their fight,\" he says. \"I didn\\'t make this world, I only want to live in it, and I want to give them their best fight in court.\" In 1990, Goldberg found himself in the defendant\\'s seat when the feds mounted a civil asset forfeiture case in which they tried to seize his Mag Mile condo and his Porsche. The Department of Justice at the time was aggressively pursuing such cases against many drug dealers\\' attorneys; the government viewed their work as aiding and abetting crime and it repurposed their assets to fund the war on drugs. One of Lloyd\\'s personal lawyers, the famed F. Lee Bailey, whose clients have included \"Boston Strangler\" Albert DeSalvo, Patty Hearst, and O.J. Simpson, had to forfeit $90,000 in fees from Lloyd around that same time, and many millions from other clients in the ensuing decade.\\nOn a bulletin board assistant state’s attorneys once alerted colleagues about Goldberg’s prowess: “WARNING: AVOID AT ALL COST!”\\nCourtesy Stuart V. Goldberg\\nGoldberg says the forfeiture attempt was just another one of the feds\\' tactics to get him to testify in Greylord cases, which were still being tried well into the 90s. Or perhaps to punish him for his resistance. In the course of the forfeiture case the prosecutors also tried to introduce evidence that Goldberg had bribed court clerks in the early 80s, but the judge denied the motion, saying these claims had nothing to do with the forfeiture case. The feds never tried to bring these charges again in a separate case, as the judge advised. During the jury trial, Lloyd testified that Goldberg carried $168,000 of his money in the Porsche. Convicted con artist and jailhouse snitch Tommy Dye also alleged that Goldberg had purchased cocaine from him and transported it in that car. But their stories were full of inconsistencies, and Goldberg\\'s lawyer Dennis Berkson eviscerated them during cross-examinations. The jury acquitted Goldberg in 1991. As he was leaving the Dirksen federal courthouse, Goldberg recalls telling assistant U.S. attorney Mark Flessner: \"Friedrich Nietzsche said, \\'Whoever seeks to protect society from monsters should see to it they don\\'t become the monster.\\' You and the federal government are the monster.\" After that case Chicago began to feel unbearable to Goldberg. \"I got so turned off with the corruption,\" he says. \"The feds were worse than the corrupt people in the state government.\" He decided it was time for a change and moved to California in 1992. His intention at first was to pass the California bar and continue practicing law. But he decided to live at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills, where he soon met plenty of people connected to the movie business who told him he should write screenplays instead. Though he had no previous experience or interest in creative writing, over the next six years Goldberg poured himself into screenplays, mostly on the theme of criminal law in Chicago. \"I loved it so much, I never wanted to go back to law,\" he says. \"Law is singing and writing is flying.\" He says a major studio optioned several of his screenplays. He met Sylvester Stallone, Steven Seagal, and George Clooney, and says at one point or another each of them expressed interest in making a movie with him. He says that he was called in to read the script of The Fugitive based on his expertise as a Chicago lawyer. He says he pitched Oliver Stone. But none of his projects ever got the green light, and he started to suspect people were just using him for his money. \"\\'Cause everyone was saying \\'You\\'re the greatest, I love you. Could you pay for the bill?\\'\" When he\\'d ask about one of his screenplays getting made into a movie, the studio rep or actor he\\'d taken out for a drink or a meal would say \"\\'Maybe next year\\' or \\'I\\'ve got another movie I\\'m doing now, but you\\'re still a great writer.\\' Everyone bullshitted me so much—and I have pictures with Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Cuba Gooding but could never, never get a movie made.\" Eventually Goldberg ran out of money and had to move out of the Four Seasons, then out of a rental apartment. He sold his car and gave up altogether, returning to Chicago. \"I was in a sarcophagus. A mummy. I wasn\\'t broke—I owed money.\" He moved into his sister\\'s basement. After 18 years of practicing law and building up a formidable fortune, he\\'d thrown it all away on a dream. Emerging from the stupor of this failure, he put on his last suit, borrowed $25 from his girlfriend for cab fare, and headed to the gloomy neoclassical edifice of the Cook County Criminal Court, which was still devouring casualties of the war on drugs by the thousands. People immediately recognized him in the hallways. He says he got $900 worth of business in his first ten minutes back in the building. \"And I\\'m thinking, Schmuck, do you want to be a broke-dick writer the rest of your life? Or do you want to be a rich lawyer?\"\\nGoldberg with nephew Matthew Kaplan and longtime client Kolby “Big Mo” Craig\\nCourtesy Stuart V.

Hers are songs of empowerment and cathartic healing for the displaced and brokenhearted. It\\'s a kind of thesis or mission statement MILCK first declared on her anthemic hit, \"Quiet,\" the song that blew up after she performed it with a group of a cappella singers at last year\\'s Women\\'s March in Washington, D.C. \"It\\'s about helping people who have felt silenced reclaim their power,\" she says.\\nIn the year since releasing \"Quiet,\" MILCK has signed with Atlantic Records and just released her debut EP, This Is Not The End. On this edition of All Songs Considered she talks about the new music, her struggle to make it as a musician while preserving her Chinese American identity, how courage and truth can lead to widespread healing and much more.\\nYou can hear the full interview with the listen link at the top of the page and read edited highlights below.\\nMILCK on how her song \\'Quiet\\' went viral following her performance on the National Mall and how some people misinterpreted it\\n\"It was just an inundation of calls and e-mails [after the Women\\'s March] and [the media] wanted to know the background of this song. At that time, everyone wanted to see if this was an anti-Trump song, like why did I write this as an anti-Trump song? And I was faced with my first fork in the road because this had never happened to me, this type of attention. I know that what\\'s juicy and what people wanted is to talk about that anti-Trump factor, but that\\'s not where the song came from. This is about something, in my perspective, a little bigger. It\\'s about reclaiming my power and helping people who have felt silenced reclaim their power regardless of party lines. I wrote [it] from a place of not feeling safe in my home. I think what\\'s interesting is that when the song went viral a lot of us, as Americans, didn\\'t feel safe in our own country, in our own home. I think that was part of the reason why this song connected with people.\"\\nOn her struggle to make it as a musician and preserve her identity as a Chinese American with immigrant parents\\n\"I\\'ve been an independent artist for eight years. And I remember around year five or six, there was a person interested in managing me and he was kind of scratching his head. He\\'s like, \\'Well I don\\'t know how to break a Chinese American artist here. Maybe you should go back to China.\\' And I kind of panicked because I don\\'t view China as my home. I view America as my home. I\\'ve been presented that strategy many times, especially when I was first coming up. But I\\'ve just been really stubborn about wanting to do my art here. And so, I\\'ve just been following my instincts and trying to stay as grounded as possible.\"\\nOn what she was most inspired to write about for the new EP\\n\"I remember walking into a writing session shortly after \\'Quiet\\' went viral and it was like, \\'let\\'s write some movement songs!\\' And I froze up. I immediately felt really uncomfortable. I was like, I don\\'t think I can do that. I think I just need to continue writing really honest songs. So, the thing that I started writing about a lot actually was my family and my dad and my mom and my sister and these people who have had these really important roles in my life. I started really reflecting on them in a different way because I finally felt like maybe I can do this, truly do this as a living and have a good life and have an audience to speak to. My dynamic with my father has changed so much. He really didn\\'t want me to do music. He was very upset that I left UC Berkeley and decided to go off on this path. Growing up as an American kid with traditional Chinese parents there\\'s so much unspoken tension. And I was the black sheep in the family [but now] I\\'ve actually found a home for myself. For so long I felt like I didn\\'t know where my home was. And actually, there\\'s a whole other family out there and it\\'s a global family because when \\'Quiet\\' went viral, I started getting a bunch of messages from men and women and they were calling me \\'sister.\\' They\\'re like, \\'thank you, sister.\\' And I would reply, \\'thank you, brother. Thank you, sister.\\' It was worldwide.\"\\nOn the flood of stories about sexual assault and harassment in recent months and how courage and truth can lead to widespread healing\\n\"It\\'s unfortunate that I\\'m sure about this, but I\\'m sure a lot of people have felt this type of feeling of suffocation from being a survivor of abuse or oppression. This type of sexual assault and abuse is rampant. And I feel really, really grateful to be able to be alive at this time. I feel good about this movement because ever since I was 14 and experienced abuse, I carried it around and thought it was my fault [that] I was the slut and brought this on [me]. And I was ashamed of myself for years and I punished myself. Now we\\'re saying this is not the case. This was actually not my fault. And once I was able to say it out loud, my healing process began. And the thing is, the more people heal, the more they will be able to heal others. I learned this at the U.N. Women Conference. I heard that women are viral. If we look at a circle of women and there\\'s one woman who is well, she will naturally heal that circle of women she\\'s with. And within that circle of women, there\\'s going to be other social circles that bud off of each of the other individuals standing in that circle. And those women will start healing those circles and it just kind of spreads like this scientific marvel, like this budding of healing. So, I feel great because once we can heal from these basic carnal hurts, then we can take back our power on this physical level and we\\'re going to have more confidence to take back power on other levels, like economic levels, political levels.

Again the day was sunny and unseasonably warm, and again people poured into Grant Park from all over Chicago and the suburbs. Pussy hats came out of retirement and signs that had been sitting in closets and basements for the past 364 days got a second life. (There were some updates too: shithole hats and signs that referenced #MeToo, Time\\'s Up, girtherism, and the government shutdown.) Once again, the crowd was larger than anticipated—300,000 people this time, 50,000 more than last year—but still peaceful, and once again, we all chanted \"What does democracy look like? This is what democracy looks like!\"But there were a few significant changes. For one thing, this year there was actually a march. Last year, overwhelmed by the size of the crowd and concerned for everyone\\'s safety, the organizers had ended the event after the rally in Grant Park and people had swarmed up Michigan Avenue and into the Loop on their own. On Saturday marchers funneled into Van Buren and Jackson and Adams and followed the planned route to Federal Plaza.Perhaps even more significantly, this year\\'s march had a clear plan of action. Last year\\'s march came together in the weeks following the election in defiance of Donald Trump and everything he stood for. It was comforting to be out in the streets of Chicago with a quarter of a million other people who also hated him and everything he stands for. In the past year, we\\'ve seen exactly how shitty a president he\\'s turned out to be, how completely unfit he is to govern—no matter what his doctors might say about his physical and mental health. We\\'ve seen how complicit the Republican government has been and how Congress has decided taxes and health care are political footballs to knock around instead of actual policies that affect the lives of actual people. We\\'ve also seen the importance of doing the one thing we have control over: showing up and casting our ballots on Election Day.So this year, we marched along a definite march route with a definite goal: On November 6, we all shouted, we\\'re going to get those fuckers out of there. Already, 390 women have announced their intention to run for the House, 49 more are running for the Senate, and of those, 228 are challenging incumbents.And in the meantime, we got to show off some pretty good signs.', \"Yes, Scarlett Johansson was calling out James Franco in her Women's March speech\\nScarlett Johansson commands the stage at the 2018 L.A.

The shock, pain and grief are immeasurable, but thank you to all who have reached out. We will be having a gathering tomorrow at The Ivy Room, 3pm-6pm and his funeral will be Saturday in Onawa, Iowa where he was raised. (204 comments) jayzombie I’m at a loss for words. I’m sorry from a far away acquaintance isn’t even enough to make up for the pain and emptiness you must be experiencing. Hoping you are able to find strength while navigating such a devastating loss […] On New Year’s Eve 2016, Anjali Pinto and her husband, Jacob Johnson, a furniture maker who’d grown up in Iowa and met Pinto in 2012, spent a quiet day in their Andersonville apartment. They wanted some time together before she flew to New York with her sister for a short getaway and he drove to Michigan to see a concert with friends. Around dusk, after waking from a nap, Pinto found her husband on the bathroom floor, his eyes closed, like he’d fainted. He looked peaceful, but he wasn’t breathing. Then came the call to 911, the EMTs, the hospital. It was Johnson’s heart. His aorta had ruptured, the result of a previously undetected flaw in the artery wall. Athletic, strong, and seemingly healthy, he died three weeks before his 31st birthday. He and Pinto had been married for 16 months. How do you make sense of something that makes no sense? Pinto, a 28-year-old professional photographer, attempted to do so in the way that felt most natural to her: through images. At the hospital, before her husband was taken away, she held his hand one last time and, instinctively, took a picture of that. “It’s kind of like the camera acts as a shield—I can’t process this right now, but I need to come back to it,” she says of her decision to take that photo. “And if I don’t shoot it, I might not remember it.” On New Year’s Day, she posted that shot on Instagram to let people know about a memorial that was being planned. Sympathy and condolences streamed in, but she didn’t want pity, she says. She wanted “to remember how amazing he was.”\\nA post shared by anjali pinto - photographer (@anjalipinto) on Feb 12, 2017 at 1:15am PST FEBRUARY 12 anjalipinto Some of the best photographs I made of Jacob hid the difficulty.

For me, it’s permanence and reality is inescapable. […]\\nIn the weeks that followed, she began posting pictures of her husband and their life together—including ones that Johnson, an avid photographer himself, had taken of her—as well as new self-portraits of her in grief. There were so many pictures to go through from the four and a half years they’d spent with each other, a photographic record of being young and in love, of working and making art, of seeing friends and family, of biking around the city and traveling the world. Pinto included with those photos of her recent past unvarnished descriptions of how she was feeling in the immediate present. “I had so much to say and so much pouring out of me,” she recalls. Advertisement Over the course of the past year, those Instagram posts—one a day, every day—have become a kind of documentary project: a tribute to Johnson and an unfolding of Pinto’s grief. Far from scrubbed clean, her Instagram feed is all the more moving for how human it is, for its intimate detail, for its willingness to acknowledge conflicted, nuanced emotions. “It’s been important to me to try to paint a picture of the real person that he was. Like, he had a stupid temper, we fought a lot about stupid shit.” Similarly, she doesn’t put an uplifting gloss on her own moods; despite striving to stay optimistic, she can just as easily “wake up with a dull ache,” as she wrote on August 14. “It doesn’t feel inspiring or revelatory, it just feels like nothing is enough.” Taken together, the posts accumulate a resonance, revealing the ways that sadness, hurt, and anger are inextricably bound up with gratitude, humor, pleasure, and joy. Pinto is sensitive to the fact that she’s not the only one who lost Johnson. “The pain of his family is equally intense, and I want to respect the way that they grieve, which is not publicly,” she says. “I don’t ever want them to feel like I’m exploiting the situation or not honoring him in some way.”\\nA post shared by anjali pinto - photographer (@anjalipinto) on Jun 23, 2017 at 1:54pm PDT JUNE 23 anjalipinto It’s been 174 days without him.

I don’t want to be a widow with a capital W. I don’t want to be a widow at all.” Pinto now has more than 50,000 followers, up from 8,000 or so when she started. She hears from strangers offering support, sharing their own experiences, letting her know how her story has helped them. “People have been wonderful,” she says. “I cry at my computer all the time.” She’s received hurtful comments, too, from people wanting to shame her for such things as posting photos of herself crying or for talking openly about dating after Johnson’s death. But, she says, they’re pushed aside in her mind by messages like one she received in September: “Please know that we’ll never get tired of hearing about Jacob.”\\nA post shared by anjali pinto - photographer (@anjalipinto) on Aug 11, 2017 at 8:18am PDT AUGUST 11 anjalipinto I often google ‘how many days since 12/31/16’.

It won’t be an ending so much as a culmination, which she’s planning to mark with a show of Johnson’s photographs and the creation of three artist grants in his honor that focus on documentary photography. Pinto continues to live in the apartment she and Johnson shared, the home where he planted the clematis that came back again this year, where he put up the shelves she doesn’t want to take down. “Loss is not felt in the absence of love,” writes poet and professor Elizabeth Alexander in her memoir of losing her husband, The Light of the World, a book that Pinto turned to in her grief.

[…]', 'Filmed at TWO by Scrappers Film Group\\nOne of the most striking images from the January 21 Women\\'s March on Washington was a photo of a cluster of white women wearing pink pussy hats and taking selfies, while a black woman, Angela Peoples, stands in front of them sucking on a lollipop and holding a sign that reads white women voted for trump. Fifty-three percent of them, in fact, as opposed to the 94 percent of black women who voted for Hillary Clinton. Since its very beginning, feminism in America has looked a lot like that photo: able-bodied, cisgender white women standing up for their rights while either remaining oblivious to all other women or noting their presence only to make sure they knew their place in the movement—bringing up the rear. (Literally, in the case of the 1913 Women\\'s March on Washington.) And for almost as long, women of color have argued that such a stance is unacceptable, and that if feminism is going to succeed, it needs to be adaptable to the needs of all women, not just women who are educated, well-off, well-spoken, and (implicitly) straight and white. Instead of feminism, Alice Walker argued, there needs to be womanism, which embraces everyone traditional feminism looked down on or excluded. Other women have found other ways to adapt their personal feminism to their own particular circumstances. Kimberlé Crenshaw, a UCLA law professor, compared this to navigating a crowded intersection where women have to choose between different allegiances to different identities. Do you stand with your gender? With your race? What if those two groups are in conflict? What do you do then? In the immediate aftermath of the election, women began planning for a march on Washington the day after the inauguration. The original organizers were white women, but very quickly they invited women of color to join them. There were discussions about intersectionality and inclusivity—not just at the march, but in feminism in general. Women of color had been having these conversations for a long time, but would they have become so widespread if Hillary Clinton had been elected president? Well, if Clinton had won, there probably wouldn\\'t have been a Women\\'s March. We would have had a woman president. Would it have mattered so much that feminism itself was divided? Then there\\'s the question, what does feminism that embraces a wide variety of women\\'s experiences look like? It starts with asking women themselves, and also putting them together in the same room so they can speak to each other directly, without interference or reinterpretation from a reporter. We invited four Chicago women from different backgrounds to lunch at Two in West Town to discuss their lives as women and as feminists. After two hours, it felt like the conversation was still just beginning, but we all hoped it would continue.\\nThey are:\\nMikki Kendall, a writer whose work has appeared in Ebony, Essence, Time, and the Washington Post and on Twitter, where she\\'s known as @Karnythia. Alicia Swiz, a writer, performer, and adjunct professor at Harold Washington College. She organizes the spoken-word series Slut Talk and Feminist Happy Hour. Sameena Mustafa, a commercial real estate broker and stand-up comic and actor who is the founder of Simmer Brown, a diverse comedy collective. Claudia Garcia-Rojas, codirector of the Chicago Task Force on Violence Against Girls and Young Women and a PhD candidate in African-American studies at Northwestern.\\nCeline Loup\\nWhat is intersectional feminism, and how do you do it? Mikki: So I want to say \\'93—and someone\\'s gonna tell me I\\'ve got my dates wrong, but whatever—Kimberlé Crenshaw coins the term.1 She\\'s a black woman, she\\'s using it to describe challenges black women face in the legal justice system because of their identity, and the ways those identities intersect. It has since expanded and been adopted, in some cases co-opted by others, to talk about the ways in which feminism has, can serve, or has failed to serve varying communities underneath this broad umbrella. I tend towards an intersectional feminist lens. I\\'m gonna plug in the idea here that there\\'s a space for a variety of feminisms underneath the umbrella, and intersectional feminism is really a hopeful meeting ground where the different interests and needs come together, and we can all consider that what is good for my community may not be good for your community, and it\\'s OK for us to have different thoughts. Alicia: In the nuances of different life experiences and race, class, privilege, comedy versus print writing even, there\\'s a lot of spaces where the influence of one can dominate the influence of another, and you have to negotiate that differently depending on the identity you inhabit. And we have to continue to explore these every time we have a conversation about something that\\'s intersectional, which is basically like everything in life. Sameena: I think there\\'s also an understanding now—what does a feminist look like, and sound like, and what does a feminist do? As someone who was raised Muslim and does not cover my hair, it\\'s one of those things that\\'s like, are you really a Muslim? Or, are you really practicing? Is there something about the Islam that you adhere to that\\'s different? I\\'ve never shied away from the feminist label, but I\\'ve seen how I show up and there isn\\'t really a place for me, and I think it\\'s almost like, \"OK, we failed somehow to bring in a variety of voices, so let\\'s make sure that we\\'re not doing that.\" And we\\'re creating a more broad base. I think inclusion is one of the most important aspects to the concept of intersectionality. Aimee: How do you do that in a practical sense? Sameena: That is the $64,000 question, because I feel like I struggle with it too. I don\\'t want to be the one that\\'s always showing up and saying, \"Remember me?\" and \"Think about me.\" But I realize that I have to do that. And that\\'s partly why, when I perform, I talk about those issues. Aimee: That goes along with the hashtag you started, Mikki. Mikki: Right, so I started this hashtag #SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen, and I won\\'t make you go through all the backstory, but one of the things about the hashtag was that there are other feminists who will show up and make you feel good about what I just told you about yourself, but often people are not listening to the quiet, calm voice until the really loud, angry voice speaks up. And I am. Alicia: Happily! Mikki: I\\'m not even sure if it\\'s a happily thing. Some people are passive-aggressive, I\\'m aggressive-aggressive. But also in terms of inclusion, sometimes the best thing you can do to be inclusive is know that you don\\'t have to have the mike, you don\\'t have to be the person speaking. To turn and hand it to someone, because you have access to this large platform, and then you say, well, you want to talk about that thing? I\\'ll sometimes get requests to come and speak about issues impacting immigrant women or Muslim women or indigenous women, and it\\'s like, \"Well, I\\'m a black girl from the south side of Chicago. I\\'m not an expert on that, but I know some people who are.\" Sometimes, unfortunately, being the person who speaks up, you become the face. I have what I call \"hood feminism,\" which is the feminism that develops outside of academia, that kind for black women in particular, it can include some womanism, and some of what we think of as traditional feminism, and some things that are really impacted by the fact that the world engages with you in a way that it may not engage with someone who is white, or light, or white-passing. And then, when you are from the inner city of Chicago, for instance, the narratives that\\'ll spring up. I would go into places where people don\\'t expect someone like me to be there—because I sound like this, they don\\'t realize where I came from—so that I can speak up for the people that they\\'re not used to having to listen to. That\\'s how the hashtag happens. I\\'m mad, and I\\'m really good, apparently, at making people hear me when I\\'m angry. Sameena: I was so angry, especially after the election, I was just livid. And then I realized, I need some allies. And even, dare I say it, white men who are allies. I said it! Mikki: I don\\'t want allies. I want accomplices. Sameena: I see what you\\'re saying. Like, be active. Don\\'t be an observer. Mikki: Yes. Sameena: I\\'ve said that to multiple people. Please do not be a bystander. We do not need bystanders, because that\\'s how we got here. Mikki: I think white men can absolutely be accomplices. I think white men absolutely should be stepping up right now—and this is like, not to lay it on you, white women, but in terms of speaking to each other about what\\'s happening in their situations, and what your friend who voted for Cheeto McTinyPaws had to say. Sameena: After the election, someone who I had thought of as not someone who really got it reached out to me and said, \"How can I help? What can I do?\" And it led to something that was a really awesome space for women of color—I did a stand-up comedy workshop for women of color. There was a woman who was like, \"Thank you, white women, for giving up your privilege.\" She actually—she said that. And that, to me, was an example of intersectionality. Mikki: We were having this conversation, me and some genderqueer and trans friends, about the fact that there\\'s nowhere left for you to avoid having to deal with different communities. For disabled feminists, for whatever. It\\'s not just the election, it\\'s the appointments that follow the election. And someone was asking, \"Well, why is this one being called out more than this one?\" And I\\'m like, \"It\\'s not that this one\\'s being called out more, it\\'s just that the people doing the calling out of the DOE head are more visible to you because that\\'s one of those areas where a lot of lives overlap and intersect.\" And the people who are gonna call out, say, the Secretary of Agriculture or something like that, that\\'s gonna be a different group. But also, that\\'s gonna be a group that\\'s smaller just because some people don\\'t necessarily know they need to be over there speaking up, and there\\'s only so many people to go around. So if you want to see more voices talking about the thing that\\'s important to you, you\\'re gonna have to raise your voice. You cannot wait for anyone else to speak. Claudia: I think it\\'s really important for people to just pick an issue or two to work on and to focus on that, because we can\\'t spread ourselves thin and do everything. And not every issue is going to call out to us in the same way. So for me, I know that in the next four years, the thing that I want to focus on is issues of sexual violence as they primarily impact women of color but also just women in general. So that\\'s where I want to focus my energies, doing organizing in Chicago, where I was born. And I also agree that, yes, white people need to be organizing more than ever and talking to other white people more than ever, and that might mean that at certain times we\\'re gonna be in similar spaces talking to each other, but I also think that it doesn\\'t necessarily mean that we have to talk to each other. Like, I\\'m OK if there are white folks organizing or spaces that I\\'ve never been to, or, you know, I\\'m OK if I\\'m not consistently talking to white folks that are organizing. Mikki: And I think it\\'s an emotional labor question. Full disclosure: I am not an organizer. Other people have that kind of emotional range and patience. I am a person who thinks it\\'s lovely that you can talk to 37 people and try to get them all wrangled like a herd of cats, I just don\\'t have that lifestyle. I just want to yell. Claudia: Right, not all of us have to be on the streets. I think that there are so many different things that we can do. And just even looking at different historical movements, there have always been different arms to the movement. So there have been people who did the legal research and defended those that needed to be defended because of an injustice in court, or there were people who were doing research to put out pamphlets, so I think that there are so many things that individuals can tap into and can get involved in different ways, and it doesn\\'t mean that everyone needs to hold a protest sign on the street. But I do want to welcome people who want to get involved, you know. I think we need people. Sameena: There was a lot of discussion, pre- and post-Women\\'s March: Where were you when there was a [Black Lives Matter] protest? Or where were you when there was all these other things going on? And I, frankly, was not moved to attend a women\\'s march on that day. I didn\\'t feel like it was for me. But I realize that some people needed that as a catalyst, to get to that point—this is what I\\'m going to do, this is what\\'s going to light that fire under me. Or this election is what shifted my whole worldview. There was an op-ed in the Washington Post and I shared it by saying \"Becky is woke now.\" It was a woman who had never thought that any of these things affected her, and didn\\'t vote very often, and never voted in a midterm election, and just thought, \"This didn\\'t affect me.\" And now she\\'s like, \"My entire Facebook feed is no longer cat videos, it\\'s now political discourse.\" And so, a few weeks ago or a few months ago I would\\'ve said, \"Oh, god.\" But now I\\'m like, \"OK. I need people to be on my side.\" Aimee: Even if it\\'s Becky in the pink hat? Sameena: Exactly. I mean, oh my god, those hats. Alicia: As someone who\\'s worked in education for a long time, I know that I\\'ve come to an embracing of whatever gets you there. You know? I do think it\\'s important to allow people to get there even who have been absent and terrible. And what I\\'ve found, talking to white women and with white women, getting people to see privilege is so challenging. Getting people to see whiteness is so challenging. My feminism grew out of accepting my own complicity, like accepting the places where I\\'m part of the problem and that\\'s never gonna change. Like being white, I can\\'t do anything about the skin I\\'m in. I can do something about the way I live that. And same with my feminism and the choices that I make.\\nScrappers Film Group\\nHow to become a feminist Alicia: I\\'d be curious to see how everyone came to their feminism, or their feminist identity. Mikki: I grew up with another feminist, but not a \"book feminist.\" My grandmother was a woman who worked. My aunt . . . everyone worked, right? And so I grew up leaning probably a little more womanist than feminist. Alicia: Were they defining as that? Like outwardly? Mikke: They were not terms that were being used. We had some very in-depth discussions about how fighting to be able to make more work was great, but we already worked. So you need to talk about being able to get the job, that kind of thing. Womanism focuses more on black women specifically, because for a long time feminism did not define us as women. Alicia: It suggested that the women it affected were white women. Mikki: Well, and also literally. There was a saying: All the blacks were men, and all the women are white. And so womanism comes from Alice Walker.2 It\\'s created as an outgrowth of second-wave feminism, not specifically about second-wave feminism so much as it is the fact that we need a term that is for black women and inclusive of black women. Because a lot of the terms that we\\'re using in this conversation for women of color come from black women. We\\'re doing work, and then we reach out to include others, and so one of the things that we need to make sure we have are terms that are specifically for us, things that are specifically around us, because if we don\\'t, no one\\'s going to speak of us. I think of women as people who work, as women who have to achieve and succeed in all of these things. And then it becomes more about me realizing, \"Oh, wait! These structural things, it\\'s not just—\" Like, the definition of patriarchy is white men oppressing everybody else, but I have a term, and it\\'s not a great term, but I call it the white matriarchy, which is where we talk about white feminism,3 and how it profits from the labor of women of color. Like the lean-in Sheryl Sandberg feminism, where she talks about how to get a CEO position but she doesn\\'t talk about the nanny. And so, in those conversations, I think about my grandmother. I think about my aunt who got her doctorate; she\\'s a Chicago Public Schools principal. There was a weird idea that because we had done so much as women, we were going to be women men would not want. Sameena: My mother worked, and my aunt—her sister—worked. They\\'re both physicians. But my grandmother, I don\\'t actually know her level of education because she died in childbirth. And then my paternal grandmother was married at the age of ten. So, OK, there\\'s been such a huge leap to go from marrying at ten or dying in childbirth to my mother being a physician and then having five daughters who made very different choices. So I came to feminism early, whether I knew it or not—I think I feel like I was, like, a six-year-old feminist. I\\'m also a middle child, so that explains probably a lot. I was always sort of getting the shaft. But once I got to college, I discovered feminism with a capital F. That was at the same time I was dealing with coming to terms with my sexuality and exploring that. And so I started to read Betty Friedan and Radclyffe Hall, The Well of Loneliness, and that canon of feminism. But there were so few voices that were like mine. So when I found the anthology This Bridge Called My Back, by [Gloria] Anzaldúa,4 I was like, yes! And then I found Adrienne Rich and people like that. So I found academic feminism and tried to find where my voice was in it, and then postgrad I ended up working at Planned Parenthood and realized that I am kind of oblivious to the class question. I was working at a Planned Parenthood on the west side of Chicago in the Austin neighborhood and that was—I got woke, guys. That was an intense experience. I was kind of a clueless twentysomething. Most of our clientele was teenage. I think our median age was 15 to 18 and primarily African-American, and just the number of things, the assumptions I had to shed, that experience alone—there was no book that was going to teach me this. This was boots on the ground, realizing that \"Wow, I am making a lot of assumptions,\" and it was a life-changing experience. Even now I know there are class assumptions that I make because my mother was a physician and we grew up with a certain access to money, and there\\'s things I still need to learn. And so I\\'m thinking when I see people who are like, \"I\\'ve figured this feminism thing out,\" I\\'m like, \"No, you haven\\'t.\" Claudia: It\\'s a lifelong process. Sameena: It is. Mikki: I was going to say, I think we all have to start from wherever we start from—Bell Hooks used to speak to me so much and then I got older and my life changed. Alicia: And then she got all anti- Beyoncé5 and you were like, \"What are you doing to me, Bell Hooks?\" Mikki: Even before then because—well, one of the things is that I\\'m not a \"respectable\" girl.6 Sameena: Me either. Mikki: I didn\\'t grow up that way. I grew up on the periphery of that. But my parents thought the burbs would be safer. I end up in Downers Grove in the middle of high school. It\\'s the 1990s, so we\\'re going to call that the integration of Downers Grove North High School. Let\\'s be clear about how many black kids there were, and they could all fit at this table. And I end up out there and I had, prior to that point, been to majority-black schools or majority-mixed-race schools in the city, and I had no idea what whiteness as a social construct was. I knew white people. I knew individual white people, but a white-flight burb is an entirely different reality. It was weird on a number of levels, not just because I was black and out-there, but also to watch white people take out at each other. They would get aggressive at kids who were disabled, there was all of this really rigid class structure, social structure stuff going on. Like cliques in the city are just not that serious. But out there you could be ostracized for talking to the wrong person. Aimee: It was like a John Hughes movie? Mikki: I thought John Hughes was making all of that up. At Whitney Young, you\\'re with kids from different neighborhoods, and we had our concerns, but our concerns were more, we\\'re all smart kids but there were bathrooms you had to be careful going in, because you might get jumped or you might get assaulted because Whitney Young is three buildings. There\\'s Disciples over here, Vice Lords over there, and all of this other stuff you have to know. But none of that means you can\\'t talk to each other. I\\'m very comfortable—it\\'s hilarious, but it\\'s also true—with the fact that my neighbor is a former gang member who did ten years for arson, because he\\'s a really nice guy. I\\'m really uncomfortable in a room full of white frat boys because white jock boys in the burbs taught me some hard life lessons and the white boy that helps me is the guy that they think is scum. The people who were kindest to me and who have been kindest to me in my life at various points have always been folks without that much. So, I lived in public housing and did all of that as a single mom in college, and I was like, well, these people are fine. But the suburbs. Like, I don\\'t even understand how you [can be constructive and intersectional] from that place that is created out there. I get how they can vote for someone like Cheeto McTinyHands in office, but I also don\\'t know what happens when they leave that bubble. Aimee: They don\\'t leave that bubble. And they don\\'t need to. They have everything they need. Sameena: In their minds they don\\'t need to. That was the whole conversation I kept having. \"Oh, you know, I\\'m in this blue bubble,\" and then I went, \"No, I\\'m not, because all I have to do is go to O\\'Hare.\" There is no bubble. And the irony is that the people who really are the snowflakes are the people who live in Downers Grove. Mikki: And Downers Grove has been forced to diversify somewhat. Sameera: Yeah, I know brown people who live there. Alicia: My feminism definitely sprung out of that too, and similarly, like on the streets, in my lived experience, and I didn\\'t have the language until college. But I was never a respectable girl. I was loud, I\\'ve always been loud; I cannot even talk at a lower volume. I lived alone with my dad, so I had a little bit of a strange relationship with my mother, even though I came from this family of strong women. My mom was sort of the leader in redefining relationships with men in the family dynamic. She left my father, and then shortly after, my grandmother actually left my grandfather. So there are these kind of actions in my life of women being strong and independent, and I was growing up super-independent myself, and my mom didn\\'t know what to do with it, and then my dad didn\\'t know what to do with it, and I was finding my own way through the world. And I moved from a super-integrated yet still segregated community in New Jersey where there were people of color around, largely black people, but they all lived, like, in the housing projects, and we lived in actual houses. I mean, we were all poor. And that\\'s the thing, I\\'ve been thinking about this a lot lately: that it was never really explained to me. You know, no one says to you why you can\\'t go to so-and-so\\'s house after dark. And then just when I was actually in grad school, I was reading these women who were challenging my positionality, even though I completely identified with everything they were saying. Like I knew that I felt the exact same way, I just felt it in different spaces. And that even my hurt and pain and oppression and marginalization was still in some way . . . like the privilege, it takes you a while to wrap your brain around that. Like for Sameena, it was the class thing specifically that made you go, \"Oh, wait, this fight I\\'ve been fighting has so many other tributaries.\" And I think just for a lot of people, just in general, that\\'s overwhelming. It\\'s overwhelming to think about having to fight everything. For me, I was able to embrace that, and I think in an academic sense too, I was like, \"OK, I\\'m learning.\" And then in this lived experience, you\\'re like, \"How do I start fusing these two?\" Aimee: I think that\\'s the challenge. Like everybody comes to feminism through their own lived experience, and then they realize everyone else has experiences. You read about them, or you see them. And that\\'s the problem. Claudia: I think my experience goes similar to the three of you. I was raised really poor on welfare by a single mother, and was raised by five of my aunts, my mother, and my grandmother. So I was raised by really incredibly strong women, but women who had very traumatic life experiences dealing with gender-based violence, with rape, sexual assault, so I don\\'t think it\\'s a surprise that I\\'m doing the work that I\\'m doing. My mother had contemplated whether she was going to keep me or not, and decided to keep me at the end. And so, growing up, I just had all these confusing examples of women who are very strong, but when men are around, things are a little different. But I think that they did a good job raising me and my brothers, and when I got to high school, which is actually interesting because elementary school, high school, was primarily people of color. So the first time that I ever saw a majority of white people at an institution was when I went to go tour Northwestern after high school when I was thinking of going there. And I had never seen so many white people in my life. And I just remember thinking if I could get into this school, this would be like, I\\'ve made it. Like this would be winning the lottery. That\\'s the way I was raised—education is what matters. And so I just remember talking to some of the girls in the dorms, and one was, this was like during the beginning of the school year. She was crying because she didn\\'t get into Harvard, and I was like, wow. You\\'re crying because you didn\\'t get into Harvard, and I\\'m freaking out because I don\\'t even know if I\\'m gonna get into any school. I was a public policy debater, and I won, was very successful, was a state champion I don\\'t even remember how many times, and I had been offered an opportunity to apply to Northwestern for a public policy debate fellowship. And I didn\\'t believe in myself. Everyone encouraged me, and I said, \"There is no way after what I saw that I will be able to make it into this institution,\" you know. And I just don\\'t know if I could actually function in that space. Like, I don\\'t see anyone that echoes the experience that I had, which was a very beautiful experience, going to a high school where it\\'s not just that we were racially mixed, but it was also that we had refugees who were, you know, teaching us about the experiences of living in war, and asylum seekers who were talking to us about what it was to try and resituate themselves in the United States, people who did not speak English as a first language. And it was just such an incredible experience, so seeing that setting at Northwestern was really shocking to me. But when I started at DePaul, my very first quarter, I took a class with someone who is still a mentor of mine. Her name is Ann Russo, and she\\'s just a fantastic scholar, and she would teach this class called Chicago Women Activists. And it was an amazing class. It transformed my life, and I ended up founding a women\\'s newspaper that quarter called Voices, specifically to address the issues that the DePaulia, DePaul University\\'s paper, would not address. And that\\'s when I also learned the term \"feminist.\" And it\\'s not a term, like many of you had expressed before, that my family would use, because no one in my family uses the term \"feminist\" to identify that way. But I realized that feminism is a politic, is about your positionality, and how you act in society. And so I realized, like, wow, my aunts, my grandmother, my mom, they are all feminists, even if they don\\'t identify that way. But because I have access to this language, I felt it important to identify that way, and I\\'m not anyone who ever shies away from using that term. So now whenever I teach about feminism at Northwestern, I tell my students, feminism was not something that white women made. It\\'s something that indigenous and black women, women of color, gave white women. Because if we look at the history of the work the black women have done, the work that indigenous women have done, and you look at the politic that they engage in—eradicating and abolishing slavery, abolishing different oppressions of women not being able to work and get paid, those are all things that women of color have always championed. The fact that white women had particular access to introduce the term in a particular way and to advance it is different. But I always tell them it\\'s important to know that this is not something that white women handed us, it\\'s something that has always been in us and we\\'ve always been doing. Aimee: That\\'s really beautiful. Claudia: I believe it. But I also understand some people don\\'t want to identify as feminist, and I get the issues, and I also think that it\\'s important to teach the different ways in which one can identify. So a term like \"womanist\" I know is also incredibly powerful and also as critically important to have in our vocabulary as feminism.\\nMikki Kendall and Alicia Swiz\\nScrappers Film Group\\nHow to talk like a feminist Aimee: Do you think the vocabulary has been divisive? Alicia: Always and forever in America, yeah. Mikki: Part of it is that we\\'re maybe not speaking the same English. Like I use \"bitch\" really casually. I do. I grew up with it, I joke about it with friends, whatever. My current Twitter tagline is \"The bitch that starts and finishes shit.\" And it\\'s in part because, for my community, reclaiming that term was happening before white women were doing whatever the hell white women are doing. But you\\'ll see people get really upset . . . \"You called someone a bitch.\" Well, but five seconds ago, she did everything but call me the N-word, so I\\'m not sure why we\\'re this focused on \"bitch.\" But also the way in which language is used can be divisive I think maybe is more accurate, because if I\\'m talking to a trans woman and she says, \"Bitch, I love your lipstick,\" all right, thank you. And we\\'re gonna stand there, and we\\'re gonna have a conversation about makeup, and my day is gonna go on, and her day is gonna go on, whatever. If, though, a white guy says, \"Bitch, I love your lipstick,\" we\\'re going down a different road there. Alicia: The reclamation is, I find, really challenging for a lot of people. I was just rereading one of the chapters in Feminism Is for Everybody,7 because I do give my students the intro chapter. One of the things Bell Hooks says is to understand feminism, you have to understand sexism. And for me, to understand sexism, you have to understand normative gender roles. And people still have such trouble wrapping their brains around that, which is why you get this argument from people who think, \"Well, if a trans person says \\'bitch\\' to me and I\\'m this privileged white dude or privileged whoever, why can\\'t I say it too?\" Sameena: Language is important, but I don\\'t want to get caught in a discussion about terms and terminology when people are actually suffering. I mean, shit is going down. I worked on a feminist literary journal in college. And it was a lot of fun, and we had some diversity in terms of race and sexuality and that sort of thing, but I remember—this was my senior year—one of the editors wrote a poem about loving a black woman, and she used the phrase \"chocolate love.\" And I was like, \"We are not going to publish—this is the worst poem I\\'ve ever read in my life,\" and I was adamant. But I know that in her mind, she\\'s like, \"She\\'s dead to me. I\\'m never going to talk to this woman again.\" In her mind, I wasn\\'t being feminist enough, I wasn\\'t being open enough. And I was like, \"This is just hack bullshit. This is garbage.\" But that is an example of not seeing the big picture, of making it about you. And that\\'s what I think a lot of this stuff is—it\\'s making it about you and not thinking about like, How does this really impact the world? And so that\\'s where it\\'s been frustrating to me, when I went on my rants about 53 percent of white women voting for Trump—I\\'m sorry. I said it. Mikki: Cheeto McTinyPaws. Sameena: OK, OK, OK. I liked Busta Rhymes\\'s \"Agent Orange.\" But essentially, that pissed me off. I remember sharing something that was like, [this is] choosing your race over your gender. That\\'s clear. And it was maddening to me. And then I said to myself, \"OK, I need to figure out a way to not lead with anger, because it\\'s gonna eat me up. It\\'s gonna just burn me up.\" And I think about it in the context of Islamophobia too. How many stereotypes do people have about Muslims, about Muslim women, and all that goes on with that? I remember I was in a feminist space, at a feminist bookstore, doing a show with all women, and I broached the subject of Islamophobia. If you\\'re performing, you can feel the audience just recede. And I thought, Oh my god, he might win. I remember feeling just like this, and this was several months before the election. I thought, This is not good. This should be my safe space, and it\\'s not.\\nAlicia Swiz\\nScrappers Film Group\\n\\'But what about Chicago?\\' Mikki: One of the things that I think we skim over in this is that when we\\'re talking about language, sometimes language can be divisive, but also it can be a tell. Because of the people who respond to any discussion of police brutality with \"Well, what about Chicago?\" And in the middle of the \"What about Chicago?\" you already know how the rest of this conversation. Language has just told you that whatever discussion you think you\\'re having, the one they\\'re gonna have with you is that they can\\'t do anything about police brutality against black bodies as long as black people are violent with each other. But crime happens intraracially. Because, frankly, what happens is that you and your neighbor are having a fight about whatever it is, and your neighbor has a gun or a knife, or you have a fistfight and you hit your neighbor too hard—all of that happens, period, in communities, because that\\'s how humans work. Sameena: We\\'re in Chicago, one of the most segregated cities there are. Mikki: Actually, we\\'re not one of the most segregated cities. Chicago\\'s not even in the top 20 of segregated cities in America.8 However, if you take out the requirement that white people be in the neighborhood, Chicago\\'s actually a pretty integrated city in the areas that are not white dominated. I have neighbors that are Mexican, I have neighbors that are Muslim, I have neighbors that are a lot of things, but I live in South Shore. What I don\\'t have a lot of are white neighbors. You see everything else out on the sidewalk in my neighborhood. If you go to Pilsen, if you go to a lot of the border communities like Austin, you\\'ll see a lot more integration. And even with the way segregation has worked in Chicago, Chicago is not going to have that many white people in these neighborhoods because there\\'s just not that many white people in Chicago. White flight took most of them out. They come in, they go downtown—this is why there was the whole thing about people who say they\\'re from Chicago but they\\'re really from Evanston. Alicia: You\\'re really speaking to a lot of America that doesn\\'t have any experience with cities, urban settings, or having gone out of, like, ten miles of their town. Fox News is still the most-watched news network. Now it also is because maybe people like us just aren\\'t watching the news. This is what I try to remind my students. I have a PowerPoint, it\\'s like, we\\'re gonna look at the CEOs of the six media companies. That\\'s right, I said six. Did you think there were more? There\\'s not! And it\\'s a PowerPoint of all white men. Like you\\'re looking at it, and they\\'re all old as fuck . . . Mikki: And they live in white-flight burbs, predominately white areas. Because this ties into a thing I talk about a lot—false history. When we\\'re talking about all of this, and what people are nostalgic for with that tagline about making America great—when you actually talk to the people who are saying that, and they describe the America that they think they should\\'ve had, you realize in the middle that they\\'re talking about Donna Reed. Alicia: Right, about an America that never really existed. Mikki: They are literally talking about TV shows. And then it\\'s the same thing with police brutality, what we don\\'t really talk about. But I\\'ve noticed more and more, and lately I\\'ve been thinking about this: We teach people police brutality is normal, with every Dick Wolf show, with every NYPD Blue, all of those shows, because by the end of the show, in order to save the kid, in order to save the pregnant woman, in order to stop the serial killer, someone\\'s rights have been violated. Several people\\'s rights have been violated. And the person at the beginning who was innocent, maybe we get a special episode where that person gets an apology, that person\\'s family gets an apology because they\\'re dead. But mostly, there\\'s no impact for them, that they got beat up by a cop.\\nClaudia Garcia-Rojas\\nScrappers Film Group\\nHow to be an accomplice Sameena: OK, here, you\\'ve got the whole issue of class and gentrification, you\\'ve got not really understanding or not being culturally competent. And then we\\'re still dealing with sexism and racism and all this other stuff. And that\\'s a more comprehensive look at things, where it\\'s not just about race. And it\\'s not just about one thing. It\\'s like, how do we create that narrative and that dialogue? And I think that still is a challenge. Because you look at people who are trying to be advocates—I\\'m actually a really big fan of Van Jones, but he\\'s got this Love Army thing he\\'s doing,9 and part of me is like, \"I don\\'t know if I\\'m too angry to be a part of a love army.\" You know? Claudia: That\\'s not going to address the institutional issues. Sameena: I know, that\\'s what I\\'m saying. It feels good to people who don\\'t want to feel bad. Mikki: I was gonna say, so this is Van Jones offering to do some version of emotional labor. I will not be joining the army. But this is a very respectable approach to oppression. Nobody wants to talk about how we fight once the fighting is not clean. What we do—because we all love those stories from our grandparents who fought Nazis—we sort of skim over the fact that there\\'s a body in the ground at the end of that story. We just hear that our heroic grandpa really fought the Nazis, or whatever. And I think this is a thing that\\'s sort of difficult, depending on your background or where you come from. The idea, like, we have a zero tolerance for fighting, and people are not supposed to fight. And then we get to a point where sometimes maybe violence is necessary, or maybe really not caring about someone\\'s feelings is necessary, or really hurting someone\\'s feelings is necessary, or whatever. And people are very uncomfortable with it. And I think that one of the things when we\\'re talking about how this stuff intersects is it goes back to the idea that not everything is a feminist issue, when really, if it affects women, it is a feminist issue. That\\'s a messy place. Sameena: I think about my own communities and I think, How have my own communities done racism? Or sexism? And I\\'m coming from a community that is incredibly sexist and incredibly racist. There was a major Muslim scholar who was speaking, and he was being interviewed, and he actually said something back to the whole narrative of like, \"Oh, we have this issue because there\\'s so much black-on-black crime.\" I\\'m like, \"Really? You\\'re really gonna do this? As a Muslim scholar, you\\'re really gonna go there?\" Like, shut the fuck up. Stop talking. It\\'s time to listen. To be honest, people don\\'t really know the history or the context. There\\'s a reason why people are angry about white feminism, because the suffragist movement was incredibly racist. That is what is somewhat frustrating, and even something I\\'m still learning about. And people are making statements without having that context, having that history. Claudia: Or they have it, but they don\\'t want to acknowledge it, because then you have to talk about it and address it. Sameena: Yeah. Somehow it\\'s funny, because it sort of works both ways. If you talk about racism, then it\\'s like, oh, I as a white people am feeling guilty, which is ironic. Because it\\'s like when a terrorist attack happens, it\\'s like, oh Muslim people, please take responsibility for it. So it\\'s that weird desire to either place culpability or feel it—it\\'s like this weird continuum. It\\'s hard to shake. It\\'s like, no, that person isn\\'t responsible for everybody. And so that\\'s why I\\'m like, Wait, I can\\'t blame all white people for racism, but I can say, \"You benefit from it.\" Mikki: \"And you sustain it.\" Claudia: I was co-teaching a class called Unsettling Whiteness these past two, three years at Northwestern, and one of the ways in which the class is taught is that whiteness is a politic that we can all engage and advance. And obviously, whiteness benefits white people, because you\\'ve got the racial hierarchy where white people are at the top. But this class is amazing, because we get white students to talk to each other about whiteness, which you never see happening. I did want to take us back specifically to the issue of language. One of the things that came up was when the thing came out that Agent Orange was sexually assaulting—or where we found out that he admitted he\\'s a sexual assaulter—the fact that all these white men were brought into the media to define what sexual assault is. And I think that that\\'s where we need to look at how language helps construct our society. It\\'s not the only element, but it\\'s one of many, and I think it\\'s important, because when you have a situation like that where women are not being brought in to actually define the terms of what that is, you have white men saying, like, \"Sexual assault is really not a thing,\" and they\\'re elected officials. This was happening towards the end of the election. Alicia: And this has been happening for our entire history. Claudia: Right, because everyone at the top of the media hierarchy is either a white man or, when we go down a little bit lower, it\\'s white women who tend to be media gatekeepers. When I look at that, I was just thinking about the fact that, wow, it really does matter how we use language, and how we\\'re thinking about it, because this is impacting people and it\\'s framing people\\'s minds and their psychology. Aimee: It gives us the terms to talk about things too. Like \"sexual harassment,\" there was no word for it. It happened but you couldn\\'t put a label to it.\\nSameena Mustafa\\nScrappers Film Group\\nA portrait of a feminist as a young girl Alicia: We were all having these feminist experiences, and even if they were defined as another word that we felt more comfortable with, we were having these feminist experiences. I remember hearing the word \"feminist\" in one of my first classes in undergrad and being like, Oh, that\\'s what I am. People write books about this? And this light goes off. When I really started feeling like the word speaks to me, it was empowering, it really was like, there is a community for me. And even the process of starting to challenge my privilege, and starting to question all that—what was so disruptive about that for me was that feminism was thus far the only thing that I really felt like myself in. I\\'ve always felt strongly that being a girl or a woman is amazing, and I\\'m never gonna apologize for it, I\\'m never gonna say, like, my feminism isn\\'t about being these traditional things that they\\'ve told me to be. I did a lot of research on girlhood, and one of my ideas around girlhood was the slumber party thing. It was what my experience of what girlhood looked like. And I was like, \"What? You mean some girls didn\\'t have slumber parties and roller skating?\" It rocked my world. Mikki: And see, I never had that universal girlhood education. Alicia: I\\'m sure so many people haven\\'t. Which I get now. Mikki: Well, I also didn\\'t have that universal girlhood expectation. I was in a conversation, and someone was like, \"You haven\\'t said much,\" and I was like, \"Well, part of the problem is that I didn\\'t know girlhood was supposed to be universal.\" I always just assumed that we were all doing different things in those years, because we\\'re not all in the same situation. I didn\\'t have the suburban family and whatever that girlhood was being depicted as in the 80s. I\\'m born in \\'76, so a lot of imagery didn\\'t reflect me until I started creating it. If you\\'re a black girl who grows up in the hood living with grandparents like my backstory, there was never a place in the definition of girlhood for us, except as one of the at-risk girls who deserves to be left behind, and I didn\\'t get that message either, because, dear god, if I had told [my grandmother] Dorothy Gamble that I was not gonna finish high school, the end of the world would have followed. Old black women from Mississippi, you do not tell them things like that. When I came to \"feminism\" as a term, I never quite felt like I had to situate myself in this idea of gender over race. Because for me, they\\'re not divisible. They go together all the time. I\\'m not going to be more black than I am woman, or more woman than I am black. This is my identity, you\\'re gonna deal with it, was sort of how I grew up. You know, and womanism, I think, lends itself to that idea, that, like, the identity you inhabit is the one that belongs to you, and nobody else gets to tell you how you sit in that space. There\\'s other problematic things about womanism—I\\'m not gonna say there\\'s nothing problematic about womanism. I don\\'t identify as a womanist, but I did learn a lot about setting boundaries around identity and the idea that you had to be separated from womanism. Sameena: Growing up and having those sort of role models and having that experience of girlhood, I always feel like my childhood and my girlhood was always defined by my limitations, by what I couldn\\'t do. I couldn\\'t wear shorts, or I couldn\\'t eat pork. I ate pork today. Growing up, the limitations were clear. And some of them were because I was a girl, some of them were because I was Muslim. So I remember telling other kids, \"Oh, we can\\'t eat pork, we can\\'t wear shorts,\" [and they were] like, \"Your religion sucks.\" That is a classic response. When you\\'re six years old, it\\'s like, \"You can\\'t have hot dogs? Your religion sucks.\" So it was always about the limitations. As I got older, as I got more mature, I was like, \"Oh, no, that doesn\\'t apply.\" It was just slowly knocking down those barriers. For someone who has never felt barriers or felt limitations, it\\'s like, How can you think of yourself as a feminist if you\\'re covering your hair? How can you think of yourself as a feminist if you don\\'t feel like you can go and be in integrated spaces? If you go to a mosque today the women are praying in the back and men are in the front. Sometimes there are separate entrances, sometimes they have completely separate buildings. But I think those women would consider themselves feminists. Claudia: But it\\'s about the work that they\\'re also doing. They might be in a separate room, but what work are they doing to advance whatever politic, or what kind of community work are they doing? Or even in the family. You might not be involved in five different organizations, but it might also just be how you\\'re raising your kids and what kind of ideology you\\'re passing on to them. But I was going to say I had a similar upbringing even though my family—well, we\\'re mixed race so I\\'m not going to go into all of the things that we\\'re made up of. Alicia: All your intersections. Claudia: Yeah, all of my intersections. This arm is Mexican, this arm is— but it\\'s interesting, because I wasn\\'t allowed to wear certain things because my older brother was someone that would always watch over me and say I couldn\\'t wear lipstick because I was looking too much like a prostitute, I couldn\\'t wear shorts. And because we\\'re poor I inherited a lot of my brother\\'s clothing, so I grew up very much a tomboy. And because my mother was working full-time I had to raise my younger brother. I can\\'t say I had an experience that is defined by girlhood because I was too busy to even think about that. I was busy thinking, I\\'m responsible for my younger brother, I\\'m responsible for getting us out of the situation, and I have to work hard to make sure that that happens. And that was really my childhood. So that\\'s why I wear lots of red lipstick nowadays and have the collection of different colors and wear all the girly things, because now I can do that for myself and I choose to. Alicia: And being able to have that choice is empowering, but if somebody doesn\\'t have that choice or makes a different choice, that\\'s empowering too. Mikki: And I think it also is a very situational thing. I don\\'t remember being able to do a lot of things, but a lot of those restrictions were because of where we lived and gun violence. Chicago\\'s actually not as violent as it was when I was a kid, particularly in the neighborhood where I grew up. So I spent a lot of time either in the house or in someone else\\'s house. But I didn\\'t associate that so much with me being a girl as I did with the fact that my grandmother was overprotective and also she had an entire coterie of other overprotective friends that meant that I was busy and I didn\\'t always feel the lack of being able to go outside, but also I think about the restrictions that sometimes kids are facing that sometimes kids don\\'t know about. They know they\\'re restricted, they know that there\\'s a reason given and sometimes that reason is, you know, something as mundane as their brother\\'s issues, but sometimes there\\'s no reason given because no one wants to tell kids the truth about their situation. Claudia: Right, yeah, I agree with that. Alicia: American culture is very individualistic, and I\\'m coming from a very communal culture. It\\'s not about you, it\\'s about the family and the community and what your impression is of the community, and so, so much of that is still at play here in America, and so that\\'s the challenge. Like, \"OK, you\\'re shaming your family, your community, and you\\'re not respecting—\" Claudia: The family name. Alicia: Right. Mikki: And my family didn\\'t have that. I was Ms. Gamble\\'s granddaughter, but Ms. Gamble ran numbers. So there was a certain caveat of respectability in the sense that if I wanted to buy drugs or something like that, I would not have been able to because everyone knew my grandparents, but the reasons for them not telling me something like that were not entirely because I was too good of a girl.\\nScrappers Film Group\\nWhat we do now Sameena: As far as intersectionality and feminism, on a hopeful note I feel like there\\'s been a lot more—\"enlightenment\" is the word I\\'m going to use today. I feel like that\\'s a good thing, and that\\'s a shift. One good thing is that there\\'s been an awareness and people who have had their head in the sand for a variety of reasons, now they\\'re like, \"Oh, this is a problem, and I can do something about it.\" And so if there\\'s an opportunity to create more discourse like this or make people aware that this is possible—I think a lot of people don\\'t imagine that something like this is possible \\'cause the country is too divided. Mikki: I think part of this is going to be about listening, being willing to listen and, like, listen, not just hear the words the other person said so you can respond to them, but, like, listen to what they said and sit with \"You\\'re wrong\" or sit with \"You\\'re right\" or sit with \"You\\'re different\" or whatever. Because I think part of what made this really great, but also harder to construct on a large scale, is that we\\'re in a small quiet place, there\\'s food, we had to listen to each other to engage in this conversation. I\\'m not quite sure how we translate small-group work, but that might be an interesting thing to see is people creating groups like this: brunch, whatever, where you and four women who are nothing like you go out, sit down, and have that conversation, as a small-scale effort for folks who maybe don\\'t march or can\\'t march. I have a bum leg, I don\\'t do marches because after 500 feet my leg is going to have a conversation with me, but I\\'m totally willing to have a sit down at brunch or a mimosa and discuss feminism with you. I\\'d definitely do that. Claudia: I just want to say that I really appreciate this because, for instance, I am so inundated with work right now I really appreciate just being able to connect with new people. I didn\\'t know any of you before this moment, so whether we build relationships after this moment or not, I just really appreciate having had an opportunity to meet face-to-face with people—with all of you—and have really great conversation and to also just learn about each of you individually. Alicia: Echoing the sentiments, I really feel that in real-life interactions and taking—when you were speaking, I was thinking about the risks that are hard for people to take, to even say, \"Do you want to have brunch?\" I\\'m really excited about this new idea of journalism, this idea of let\\'s bring women together to talk and it\\'ll be in print, but it will also be in this dynamic, sharing food and sharing these human creature comforts that connect us all. As safe as we can make a dialogue, we all came into it knowing that we were going to hear what each other has to say, and [it will] be nice if we can help empower people to just feel that comfortable in their lives, and I think we\\'re all working on that, right? Mikki: Right, that\\'s what I was going to say. In terms of the risk factor, I think that starting with people you already know and with whom you share interests, even if your directions are different, definitely made this easier. We know some people in common but I don\\'t think any of us knew each other before today, but I totally had fun. v', 'Design’s primary sense is indisputably sight, but for the Japanese designer Yuri Suzuki , hearing is just as important. “One fascinating thing is that hearing itself is the closest sense to the brain. It’s more effective than sight,” Suzuki says. “It is really powerful and has to be really carefully designed. But it’s totally invisible and the effect is so difficult to prove, so it hasn’t been investigated for a long time.”\\nSuzuki runs an eponymous sound design studio in London, where he creates experimental instruments and sound installations for companies like Disney and Google. His musical platform Ototo lets you play music using any object that conducts electricity, like pots, pans, fruits, and vegetables. Another project, Looks Like Music, features a robot that drives along lines it identifies on paper, playing different notes depending on what color users scribble over its track. As designer-in-residence at the Design Museum in 2012, he created a radio out of a circuit board modeled on the London Underground. Now, he’s writing a book about sound design and its psychological impacts, in an attempt to codify this area of design.\\nSuzuki, who is dyslexic, started his career as a musician but struggled to read conventional music notation. Many of his musical inventions are deliberately designed to be accessible to anyone who can’t read traditional sheet music.\\nWhile in London, I spent some time with Suzuki at his studio, where we discussed sound design and he demonstrated how his accessible instruments work. Before long, I was using the AR Music Kit he developed for Google to strum chords using nothing but a piece of cardboard and some Post-its.\\nIf Suzuki’s vision for the future of music and sound design comes to pass, then anyone–even those with learning disabilities–can join the band.KS', 'Sebastian Hidalgo grew up in Pilsen, an old Chicago neighborhood, when it was still Chicano through and through: Day of the Dead, Virgen de Guadalupe, Mexican Independence Day and other traditional festivals filled the community calendar. Murals from the late 1960s turned buildings into canvases, alleys into museums. And the food — â\\x80\\x9cauthentic Mexicanâ\\x80\\x9d a restaurant critic called it — came straight from wherever the chefâ\\x80\\x99s roots lay, be it Michoacan or Mexico City.\\nIt was as if the Mexicans who settled the former Slavic enclave southwest of downtown in the early 1960s brought the old country in their bags to seed the new one. By the 1980s, the descendants of the Czech immigrants who named Pilsen a century ago (after a city in what is now the Czech Republic) had moved out. About 95 percent of Pilsenâ\\x80\\x99s residents were of Mexican descent.\\nTo Mr. Hidalgo, just 22 and a freelance photographer, Pilsen was everything.\\nThe neighborhood, 2.8 square miles of cottages and three-flats (Chicago slang for three-family, detached houses), endured its share of inner-city ills – gang violence, poverty, drugs. But it had spunk. Growing up where activists and artists proud of their heritage – his heritage – received respect and support sparked his interest in engaging in local struggles and triumphs.\\nEspecially now.\\nPhoto\\nPilsen, like working-class communities of color all over the country, is gentrifying. It began nearly two decades ago, but the pace has picked up since the end of the recession. New residential buildings have sprung up; wealthier, non-Latinos have moved in; and restaurants and pubs catering to the new demographic are inhabiting old storefronts.\\nIn a pattern familiar to other rapidly gentrifying Latino neighborhoods, like San Franciscoâ\\x80\\x99s Mission District and Los Angelesâ\\x80\\x99s Boyle Heights, Pilsenâ\\x80\\x99s long-time residents are being pushed out. Mr. Hidalgo, as worried as anyone that the community could be lost, decided to document it.\\nArmed with a fellowship from City Bureau, a non-profit journalism lab that supports community reporting, Mr. Hidalgo spent just shy of two years capturing Pilsenâ\\x80\\x99s everyday people. He calls the project â\\x80\\x9cThe Quietest Form of Displacement in a Barrio.â\\x80\\x9d The â\\x80\\x9cquietâ\\x80\\x9d part refers to the alienation long-time residents experience every day.\\nMr. Hidalgo, who first picked up a camera as a boy, has documented anti-Trump rallies, gentrification protests, a lowrider festival, an underground dance club, neighborhood icons and characters. On one otherwise ordinary day, he wound up at the scene of two separate drive-by shootings, rare in Pilsen, if not Chicago.\\nHe also photographed a former community center, Casa Aztlan, on the day it became a metaphor for gentrification. The shuttered buildingâ\\x80\\x99s facade was adorned with one of Pilsenâ\\x80\\x99s oldest murals, an homage to famous artists and activists. The new owner, ahead of converting the building to 10 market-rate apartments, had the murals painted over in gray.\\nPhoto\\nAs a child, Mr. Hidalgo said, â\\x80\\x9cI used to walk to Casa Aztlan just to see the murals as a reminder of where my blood came from. As an adult, seeing the murals painted over in gray was violent to me and to others who share the same history with the community center.â\\x80\\x9d\\nHe does not pretend to be objective about Pilsenâ\\x80\\x99s upheavals, or deny that they affect him. â\\x80\\x9cI see there is no separating my work and my life,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cthat I do this work to learn something about myself and to learn about the world. It doesnâ\\x80\\x99t make me ill-equipped to do this type of conflict work, but rather allows me to put my heart and soul out.â\\x80\\x9d\\nIn fact, he began his self-education in photography as a boy in the emotional setting of his grandfatherâ\\x80\\x99s funeral. His godfather had brought a digital camera to take pictures for family members who could not attend. â\\x80\\x9cHe lent me his camera, saying, â\\x80\\x98Fill the memory as much as you can.â\\x80\\x99 And I considered this my first assignment.â\\x80\\x9d\\nHe knew then he wanted to be a photographer, he said. â\\x80\\x9cSince then, I never put the camera down,â\\x80\\x9d he said. He learned photography wandering Pilsen, â\\x80\\x9clearning how light behaved in parks, street corners, invited homes and on human features.â\\x80\\x9d Later, he realized photography offered a way to be a kind of â\\x80\\x9canthropologist.â\\x80\\x9d\\nHe plans to exhibit his project in Pilsen, and then other neighborhoods facing similar pressures of housing. â\\x80\\x9dI hope my photographs allow an audience to demand and scream for change,” he said. â\\x80\\x9cTo have them ask questions, to feel what the other person is coping with, and to consider the contributions of their circumstances.

Comedians have historically been free to take risks here and bomb spectacularly without ruining their chances at a career. In 2005, I witnessed Kumail Nanjiani perform at Weeds Tavern, where the stage was a pool table and you couldn’t hear unless you were standing right next to him. These unfortunate circumstances didn’t benefit his tepid set. Now he’s a dynamic stand-up comic who stars inand, but before that, there were countless flops at DIY Chicago shows.The city is a safe space artistically, but multiple women recently came forward with stories about how that space has never felt safe to them. Brian Posen , the creator of the annual Chicago Sketch Comedy Festival (SketchFest) and former head of Second City’s training center, allegedly made countless lewd comments about the women in his classes and took photos of their butts and cleavage. Then Ex Fest , ostensibly an alternative to SketchFest, was abruptly canceled the day it was scheduled to begin due to sexual misconduct accusations against its founder Matthew Payne. Women in comedy have resorted to creating secret Facebook groups to discuss their disgust with men’s rape jokes and unwanted advances.Our comedy institutions aren’t helping by segregating women into separate shows. Second City is currently running a “mimosa-and-madness-fueled” all-women sketch show entitled. The iO Theater hosts the excellent improv group Virgin Daiquiri but bills it as an \"all-women ensemble.\" When will female comedians be known simply as “comedians?”Ironically these are two of the few shows that pass the Bechdel test, which means at least two named female characters have a conversation about something besides men. These are also two of the few shows where women play roles other than prostitutes, nagging housewives, or nagging prostitutes.Whenever a new allegation comes to light concerning a comedian here or on a national level, I think, “Where are the good guys?” How is it possible that a comic can be lauded for his ability to read an audience from the stage when he can’t pick up on a woman’s body language or social cues offstage? (The recent accusations against Aziz Ansari demonstrate the persistence of this particular problem.) I’m finding it hard to watch my beloved Chicago comedians knowing they may be “bad guys.”It’s up to us to course correct what has become normalized behavior toward women in this town because we are responsible. Men have the luxury of creating art appreciated for its merit, whereas women, like other marginalized groups, are forced to become mouthpieces for all females. Sure, you might claim to dismiss the flippant statement, “Women aren’t funny,” but who said that in the first place? Probably a man. And I doubt anyone’s actively asking the question, “Are men funny?” We have the privilege of being praised for our jokes without anyone adding a qualifier about our gender.“But how can I change anything?\" you may ask. \"I’m just one man!” Guess what? As long as you get to tag in a female scene partner or schedule a lineup for a standup showcase, then—surprise!—you have power.So the next time you improvise, introduce your female scene partner as an architect or a senator. Make zero comments about her appearance and display zero romantic intentions. Or, when booking a lineup, include many different voices—men, women, LGBTQ performers, and people of color. Have the host introduce a female stand-up comic as a stand-up comic and replace the qualifier “lovely and talented” with “talented.” Take those extra two seconds to be mindful of the obstacles women face in our community. And I know you feel pressure to be “on” all the time, but maybe shut up and listen to stories about lecherous producers or the time a male comic whipped out his dong backstage.We need to do better. We need to do more. Every comedian in Chicago should feel safe to bomb spectacularly.', 'Martin Luther King Jr., Bostonian\\nAll\\nBy Tom Acitelli\\nAug 28, 2013, 10:10am EDT\\nToday marks the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.\\'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the National Mall.

Kelley, and director, Jean-Marc Vallée (“Dallas Buyers Club”), do not show the process of detection at all — no evidence, no clues, no cops showing up at inconvenient times. We don’t even know who’s dead, a cliffhanger (or red herring?) presumably saved for the last episode. What we do get are snippets of police interviews with a Greek chorus of minor characters — other parents from the school — who happily testify to the imperfections of the leads.\\nTurning the mystery into such a complete MacGuffin as a way to foreground the domestic drama might make sense if that drama were, say, interesting.

This is done so obviously that rather than making them more realistic, it just makes them more mushy and indistinct. If they’re so nice, why do they behave so badly to one another? The show is premised on the idea that that’s just the way it is these days for overstressed moms, which may be true in real life but isn’t, in itself, a satisfactory motivator for drama.', 'Blue pencils — sharpened, finished and ready for packaging and sale. Credit Christopher Payne\\nInside One of America’s Last Pencil Factories\\nA photographer captures a colorful world of craft and complexity.\\nBy CHRISTOPHER PAYNE and SAM ANDERSON\\nJAN. 12, 2018\\nA pencil is a little wonder-wand: a stick of wood that traces the tiniest motions of your hand as it moves across a surface. I am using one now, making weird little loops and slashes to write these words. As a tool, it is admirably sensitive. The lines it makes can be fat or thin, screams or whispers, blocks of concrete or blades of grass, all depending on changes of pressure so subtle that we would hardly notice them in any other context. (The difference in force between a bold line and nothing at all would hardly tip a domino.) And while a pencil is sophisticated enough to track every gradation of the human hand, it is also simple enough for a toddler to use.\\nSuch radical simplicity is surprisingly complicated to produce. Since 1889, the General Pencil Company has been converting huge quantities of raw materials (wax, paint, cedar planks, graphite) into products you can find, neatly boxed and labeled, in art and office-supply stores across the nation: watercolor pencils, editing pencils, sticks of charcoal, pastel chalks. Even as other factories have chased higher profit margins overseas, General Pencil has stayed put, cranking out thousands upon thousands of writing instruments in the middle of Jersey City.\\nStory continues after the photo essay.\\nExtrusions of graphite are collected for recycling.

Credit Christopher Payne\\nOver the past few years, the photographer Christopher Payne visited the factory dozens of times, documenting every phase of the manufacturing process. His photographs capture the many different worlds hidden inside the complex’s plain brick exterior. The basement, where workers process charcoal, is a universe of absolute gray: gray shirts, gray hands, gray machines swallowing gray ingredients. A surprising amount of the work is done manually; it can take employees multiple days off to get their hands fully clean. Pencil cores emerge from the machines like fresh pasta, smooth and wet, ready to be cut into different lengths and dried before going into their wooden shells.\\nOther parts of the factory are eruptions of color. Red pencils wait, in orderly grids, to be dipped into bright blue paint. A worker named Maria matches the color of her shirt and nail polish to the shade of the pastel cores being manufactured each week. One of the company’s signature products, white pastels, have to be made in a dedicated machine, separated from every other color. At the tipping machine, a whirlpool of pink erasers twists, supervised patiently by a woman wearing a bindi.\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nPayne conveys the incidental beauty of functional machines: strange architectures of chains, conveyor belts, glue pots, metal discs and gears thick with generations of grease. He captures the strangeness of seeing a tool as simple as a pencil disassembled into its even simpler component parts. He shows us the aesthetic magic of scale. Heaps of pencil cores wait piled against a concrete wall, like an arsenal of gray spaghetti. Hundreds of pencils sit stacked in honeycomb towers. Wood shavings fly as fresh pencils are dragged across the sharpening machine, a wheel of fast-spinning sandpaper.\\nIn an era of infinite screens, the humble pencil feels revolutionarily direct: It does exactly what it does, when it does it, right in front of you. Pencils eschew digital jujitsu. They are pure analog, absolute presence. They help to rescue us from oblivion. Think of how many of our finest motions disappear, untracked — how many eye blinks and toe twitches and secret glances vanish into nothing. And yet when you hold a pencil, your quietest little hand-dances are mapped exactly, from the loops and slashes to the final dot at the very end of a sentence.', 'Oprah Winfrey accepts the 2018 Cecil B. DeMille Award during the 75th Annual Golden Globe Awards on Sunday in Beverly Hills, California. Paul Drinkwater/NBCUniversal via Getty Images\\nI loved Oprah’s Golden Globes speech on Sunday. It was mesmerizing, pitch perfect, and gave voice to many lifetimes of frustration and vindication with eloquence and a full authority she has earned. But I found the strange Facebook response of “Oprah 2020” weirdly discordant and disorienting. Oprah’s speech—in my hearing—wasn’t about why she needs to run for office. It was about why the rest of us need to do so, immediately.\\nThe dominant theme I heard was about giving voice to invisible people. It was the arc of the entire speech. It’s also what the very best journalism is about, and it’s worth remembering that’s how Oprah began her career. The speech began with her goosebump-y tale of first seeing Sidney Poitier win an Academy Award in 1964 and how much of a revelation it was at the time to see a black man celebrated in America. Then it ran through to her chilling invocation of Recy Taylor, a young black woman who was raped in Alabama in 1944 by six white men who were never brought to justice. She deftly linked Taylor to Rosa Parks, who investigated the rape for the NAACP and then 11 years later refused to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery with Taylor “somewhere in her heart.” This was a speech about how seeing someone else model the fight against racism, sexism, and injustice activates us to fight alongside.\\nIt was a testament to the greatest gifts she has as a journalist, actor, and media personality: the ability to shed light on the faceless and speak of justice and morality in ways that are urgent and original. That’s why the speech honored not just the women in sleek black dresses who were on their feet cheering her. The true message was about someone else:\\nWomen whose names we’ll never know. They are domestic workers and farmworkers. They are working in factories and they work in restaurants and they’re in academia, engineering, medicine, and science. They’re part of the world of tech and politics and business. They’re our athletes in the Olympics and they’re our soldiers in the military.\\nWhat I heard in her speech wasn’t a bid to save us all, but rather a powerful charge to the young girls watching at home to tell their own stories, to fight for their own values, and to battle injustices with the certainty that they will be seen and heard.\\nIn a sense, this speech sounded in the key of Obama’s famously elusive spur to—as Gandhi urged—“be the change you want to see in the world.”\\nIn so many ways, this was a maddening proposition when it was being pushed by a moderate Democrat such as Obama. And it was more maddening still when the president told leaders on the left that he needed them to pressure him further into their corner; that he couldn’t make that move on his own. This language of citizen empowerment and responsibility is also so painfully foreign at the moment with a sitting president for whom the greatest obligation of the citizenry is to adore and thank him (and spend money on his brand). We are being trained to believe that President Trump alone creates safer skies and restores coal-mining jobs; that passively accepting his leadership is the holy grail of change.\\nBut what Winfrey and Obama talk about is the limits of top-down power. It is one of the great sins of this celebrity age that we continue to misread this message as a call to turn anyone who tries to deliver it into our savior. When someone tells you “I alone can fix it,” you should run screaming for the emergency exits. When someone tells you to get off your ass and fix it yourself, you should think first about running for office yourself.\\nSince the 2016 election, the cry one hears constantly from the left is “who will lead us?” But Democrats should have learned more than they have from November’s stunning electoral successes in Virginia. The lesson should have been that extraordinary and unknown candidates, including inspired and inspiring first-timers, could win elections without fame or fanfare.\\nWhen someone tells you “I alone can fix it,” you should run screaming for the emergency exits.\\nI have no idea whether Winfrey plans to run for the Oval Office in 2020. According to reports, she is “actively” considering it. But I heard the force and dignity of her speech as a mirror held up to the country about our own responsibilities, accompanied by a very prominent shoutout to journalists for helping to tell those stories. This was a tribute to nameless women who have faced their own #MeToo moments without receiving attention or justice, and for today’s young black girls on linoleum floors who couldn’t previously imagine themselves winning a lifetime achievement award and woke up Monday thinking they just might.\\nIt’s easy to devalue those words as cheese-puff throwaway lines. But for women who went to law school because they saw Sandra Day O’Connor on the high court (I was one) or Anita Hill before the Senate Judiciary Committee, this moment isn’t made of cheese. I will never in my life forget the lines of teenage Latina women snaked around the Senate to watch Sonia Sotomayor’s confirmation hearings. That was about more than just young people looking for a savior. We become what we see modeled and that is where #MeToo will intersect with 2018. On Sunday night, I heard Winfrey urging invisible people to speak up, become engaged, transform policy, and find their own power. It was a speech about moving from passivity and acceptance to furious, mobilized participation and a call for allies in that fight.\\nThere is an interesting side debate about whether Winfrey should run for office raging on social media. But that should be ancillary to what she actually told us to do. It took a stable media genius to attempt to peel off the narcissism and solipsism of the celebrity culture in which we all seem to be permanently lodged. Maybe it’s destined that nobody will ever again be elected president who doesn’t have a billion-dollar media brand behind them. But the speech I heard last night was about using a billion-dollar media brand to remind young women of color that they, too, have the power to save us all.', 'The women of the 2018 Golden Globes collectively (almost) wore black. On the red carpet, many of them brought as their dates not husbands and partners, but activists for gender and racial equality. They talked about endemic sexual harassment in America and a sea change sparked by industry-shattering stories from The New York Times and The New Yorker about the abuse perpetrated for decades by Harvey Weinstein.\\nThe men of the Golden Globes wore (some of them) Time’s Up pins. On the red carpet, they were asked less about Weinstein and #MeToo than about their work. They shifted uncomfortably when the actress Natalie Portman emphasized the “all-male” directing nominees in film. Accepting their awards, they thanked their mothers, their wives (in one case their wives and their girlfriends), their agents, the nation of Italy for its great food. The composer Alexandre Desplat observed that this award was a different color to the previous one he’d claimed. But, facing a sea of women wearing black, not one of the dozen-plus men who received an award seemed compelled to note that anything about the night was different. For the men of the Golden Globes—with the exception of the host, Seth Meyers, who delivered a series of jokes skewering Weinstein—it was business as usual.\\nIt was a notable disparity on an evening in which women had, for the first time in awards-show history, coordinated their color schemes to draw attention to inequality in the entertainment industry and beyond. But the women of the Golden Globes didn’t just wear black—they also used, for the most part, their minutes on the public stage to talk thoughtfully and inclusively about sexual harassment and assault in America and around the world. Accepting the evening’s first trophy for her role playing a domestic-assault survivor in the HBO miniseries Big Little Lies, Nicole Kidman praised “the power of women” and talked about the scourge of abuse. “I do believe, and I hope, we can elicit change through the stories we tell and the way we tell them,” she said. It was a moment that set a tone for the evening: Subsequent winners from Laura Dern to Rachel Brosnahan to Elisabeth Moss to Oprah used their platforms to speak about the need for women’s voices to be heard. Many mentioned the Time’s Up campaign specifically, in a coordinated effort. But the subtext men seemed to hear was that women’s voices are the only ones that matter when it comes to advocating for change.\\nAlexander Skarsgård, who played the abuser of Kidman’s character in Big Little Lies, praised the “extraordinarily talented” group of women he had the privilege of working with on the show. He wore a Time’s Up pin on his lapel. But he said nothing about the themes of the evening, or even the themes of the show he’d just won an award for. Martin McDonagh, whose film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is about a grieving mother seeking public justice for the rape and murder of her daughter, also said nothing about how uncannily the topic of his award-winning work intersected with the state of Hollywood in its post-Weinstein moment. Bruce Miller, the executive producer of the Golden Globe–winning drama The Handmaid’s Tale, was the only male award-winner of the night who even alluded to #MeToo, stating, “To all the people in this room and this country and this world who do everything they can to stop The Handmaid’s Tale from becoming real, keep doing that.”', 'Episode\\n8\\nThanksgiving is a loaded holiday for a lot of queer folks. For some, it means going back into the closet entirely. For others, it means going partially back in the closet. Maybe your family knows you’re gay, but they don’t want you to be “too gay” at the dinner table. Maybe only some family members know because it would “just be too hard” for others. The fact that Master Of None frames its Denise-centric episode around this particular holiday is significant. Lena Waithe and Aziz Ansari have written an authentic and complex story about coming out, brought to life with incredible, dream-like direction from Melina Matsoukas. It’s one of the best episodes of this ambitious series, and it’s one of the best coming out stories ever seen on television.\\nTelevision tends to treat coming out as a straightforward, linear process, cramming it into the confines of a traditional narrative arc. Master Of None, however, rarely follows a traditional narrative arc. In “Thanksgiving,” we see Denise and her family—her imposing mother Catherine (Angela Bassett), her rambunctious Aunt Joyce (Kim Whitley), and her grandmother Ernestine (Venida Evans)—celebrating Thanksgiving through the years, starting in the early 1990s all the way up to the present in 2017. We see her as a young girl, not quite out to herself or others, fixating on the women dancing in the background of D’Angelo’s videos. We see her as an awkward teen confessing her crush on a girl named Erica to her best friend Dev, not quite ready to say the word “lesbian,” substituting “Lebanese” instead. We see her come out to her mom in a diner, and we see her bring a girlfriend home for Thanksgiving for the first time, out to her mom and aunt, who are very uncomfortable the second Denise and Michelle show any kind of affection.\\nComing out isn’t a straightforward, linear process. It’s something we do all the time. It isn’t as simple as saying “I’m gay.” Master Of None does show that specific moment, the first time Denise says those words out loud to her mother. It’s a Very well done scene, playing into the nuances of the situation. Catherine doesn’t outright embrace her daughter nor does she outright reject her. Her reaction, rather, is an all too common one: She starts crying. She cries, and she tells Denise she just doesn’t want her life to be hard. Even the most loving, liberal parents often have this reaction to their kids coming out. But that reaction ignores the fact that when queer people come out, we’re happier. Our lives are better. Life’s hard living in the closet. Throughout the episode, Denise is happiest when staring up at a photo of Jennifer Aniston while high, when talking openly about her relationships with women to Dev, when wearing the masculine-of-center clothes she prefers over the dresses her mother forces her into. Catherine wonders if it’s her fault her daughter is gay, which again is an all too real response parents sometimes have. Catherine is the perfect example of someone with good intentions who still manages to say and do the wrong things, and Waithe and Ansari’s script handles that complexity well. Of course, it also helps that Bassett is a powerhouse actor. Her performance brings out the layers to Catherine, who is genuinely trying to be a good mother even if she can’t see her daughter for who she is.\\nAnd the episode doesn’t end with Denise telling her mother she’s gay. We see three more Thanksgivings of Denise navigating her identity and how to talk to her mother about it. By going back into the past to show Denise figuring out things internally, showing her express those feelings externally to Dev and her mother, and showing some of the aftermath, the ways she and her family grow over the years, Master Of None presents much more than a simple “coming out story.” The juxtaposition of Denise coming out to Dev and, later in life, coming out to her mom is compelling in and of itself. Coming out goes different ways with different people. Denise is nervous yet more comfortable talking to Dev. With her mom, she basically blurts it out out of frustration. And for both, the camerawork underscores those differences, fluid and intimate on Dev and Denise and more stiff and suffocating on Catherine and Denise. The episode’s structure—one Thanksgiving after the next—suggests that Denise’s queer journey may evolve, but it’s never really over.\\nAdvertisement\\nQueer identity can be tricky to navigate, especially if you’re the first person ever in your family to come out, as Denise seems to be, and Master Of None acknowledges that it’s hard without making it tragic. There’s plenty to laugh about in the episode, and Matsoukas imbues her directing with a complex mixture of emotions that elevate every scene. During 2017’s Thanksgiving, the time when Denise’s family is most comfortable with her queerness, the movement flows so much more smoothly than before, all smiles and joy and warm embraces as Michelle settles into being around Denise’s family again. This is ultimately a warm story about someone coming into their own. Thanksgiving can suck for queer people. And some of Denise’s do, but not all of them. She remains close with her family, even as they struggle with her identity. They all grow (including Denise, who has to grow out of her relationship with a particularly vapid Instagram addict). And eventually, the pieces fall into place, as seen in that stunning final shot. Thanksgiving on television usually hinges on family drama or unforeseen conflicts that threaten to throw the holiday off-kilter, but Master Of None taps into a deeper emotional place with its brilliant take on the “Thanksgiving episode.”\\nStray observations\\nMy friends and I often talk about our “roots”—the person, usually a celebrity or fictional character, who helped us initially realize we were gay. Jennifer Aniston wasn’t one of my personal roots, but it’s one I hear a lot, and I love that she’s so clearly Denise’s. The fact that even her mother picked up on her making eyes at Rachel on Friends is too real. I had a few roots, and they were all very obvious. My friend likes to remind me of the time I screamed at him on a bus because he said he didn’t think Angelina Jolie was pretty. We’re both gay now.\\nThe conversations Denise and her family have around the dinner table are also specific and interesting. Master Of None doesn’t whitewash its portrayal of a traditional Thanksgiving dinner. In fact, it presents a specifically Black one. Denise and her family talk about disenfranchisement (which young Denise adorably misinterprets as a franchise, like McDonald’s), the O.J. Simpson trial, and Sandra Bland and police brutality.\\nAdopted early on into the family’s tradition since his own doesn’t celebrate the holiday, Dev is present for all of these Thanksgiving meals, and the episode serves as great backstory for their friendship. This show excels at making friendships believable and meaningful.\\nThe younger actors playing both Denise and Dev impressively channel the physicalities and cadences of Waithe and Ansari.\\nIt isn’t surprising that the episode feels so real and authentic given that Waithe pulled from her own experiences .\\nAdvertisement', \"By Elliott Almond | ealmond@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group\\nPUBLISHED:\\nDecember 30, 2017 at 12:00 pm\\n| UPDATED:\\nJanuary 3, 2018 at 2:51 pm\\n(If you’re having trouble viewing this gallery or video on a mobile device, click here .)\\nSAN FRANCISCO — Dinh Tran’s path to ice skating stardom takes him past drug addicts, prostitutes and the homeless along the pungent streets of the Tenderloin.\\nThe teenager pushes his Razor scooter or takes a Muni bus to get to the Yerba Buena recreational rink about 10 city blocks from his studio apartment.

It might take two more years, but that’s plenty of time to develop into a contender for the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing.\\n“I’m dying to get that quad,” Dinh said. “But I have to be careful about hurting myself. I can’t do jumps if I hurt myself.”\\nThe skater has overcome a sprained ankle and shin splints this season to include triple axels in his programs for the first time at the upcoming championships. The axel, which requires an extra half rotation, is the first hurdle to clear before landing quadruple jumps.\\nHe’s also honing his artistic side. The skater works with Kim Navarro, a two-time national ice dancing medalist, and this year won a U.S. solo ice dance title.\\n“He is taking ownership of his own skating,” Crandell said. “The fact he picked his own music and he’s in charge of his own choreographer, that’s the growth that I like to see.”\\nAdvancing to such a high level means scheduling life around skating. A typical day includes taking the bus to the rink in the mornings, another bus to school, then yet another bus back to the rink in the afternoon and finally a bus to get home.\\nPushing the scooter is faster but Dinh only takes it when his mom can carry his skating suitcase.\\nHe also takes BART across the bay Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoons to train at Oakland Ice Center. On Saturdays, he and his mother take the train to Oakland for early morning skating.\\nThen it’s off to the gym before taking private flute lessons. Dinh has earned a scholarship for his musicality too. He plays in a jazz band at school.\\n“It keeps me on my feet,” Dinh said of juggling everything. “It is possible because I skate before school and after school and I play the flute in school. It fits just right.”\\nRelated Articles\", \"But the city’s allocation is subject to the discretion of the Department of Cultural Affairs and changing economic conditions. In recent years, as competition for donations of money and art has increased, the Met has sought to keep up with expanding museums in New York like the Museum of Modern Art, now in the midst of a major renovation, and the Whitney Museum of American Art, which recently opened a new home in Manhattan’s meatpacking district, where it is drawing large crowds.\\nOver the last 13 years, even as Met attendance has soared from 4.7 million visitors to 7 million, the museum has seen a steep decline in the proportion of visitors who pay the full suggested amount, from 63 percent to 17 percent.\\nMet admission fees provide 14 percent of its $305 million operating budget, or $43 million, which Mr. Weiss said puts the Met at the low end among its peers. That figure is expected to increase to 16 or 17 percent — or $49 million — with the policy change.\\n“We’re the only major art museum in the world that has recourse neither to mandatory admissions or significant government funding,” he said, pointing out that both the Smithsonian in Washington and the Louvre in Paris receive considerable public support. The Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim already charge $25 — though, unlike the Met, they are not in city-owned buildings nor supported by taxpayer dollars.\\n“While we understand the Met’s financial situation, we would hope they would find another solution that does not put the burden on the public,” said Judith Pineiro, the executive director of the Association of Art Museum Curators, which has members around the globe. “This is a world class museum that should be for everyone to visit and not just for people who can pay full full price or are able to show an ID. It’s sad news.”\\nThe existing pay-as-you-wish policy will continue for students from Connecticut and New Jersey, and full-priced admission tickets will be honored for three consecutive days at the Met’s three locations, which include the Met Breuer and the Cloisters.\\nPhoto\\nThe fixed admissions charge is not just a short-term shot in the arm, nor will it alone be sufficient to reverse the Met’s recent financial challenges, Mr. Weiss said. The change is intended to give the museum a predictable source of revenue at a time when institutions all over the country face competition for private donations and patrons’ leisure time; declining membership; and dwindling public dollars.\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nThe new policy was approved by the city, which owns the museum’s building. “Having a healthy Met is extremely important to New York City,” said Tom Finkelpearl, the city’s commissioner of cultural affairs. “The basic motivation was to help the Met balance its budget in a way that did not hurt New Yorkers.”\\nThe Met currently receives about $26 million from the city. Under the new admissions policy, the $15 million that goes toward energy costs like heat and light will remain intact; the remaining $11 million which offsets the Met’s operating costs (for security and building staff) will reduce on a sliding scale after the first full year, depending on how much incremental revenue the new admissions policy generates, with a cap at $3 million.\\nThe Met’s reduced portion of city funds will be redirected toward cultural institutions in underserved parts of the city, Mr. Finkelpearl said.\\nFred Dixon, the chief executive of New York’s tourism agency, NYC & Company, said he did not believe the new policy would affect the flow of visitors to the city.\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

While the museum now has a deficit of about $10 million, Mr. Weiss said it aims to balance its budget by 2020.\\nThe Met is also seeking to shore up revenue from other sources, including membership and restaurants, both of which are under review, and retail operations, which have already undergone an overhaul and are now profitable. “Our job is to get all of those to function in balance without in any way undermining our mission,” Mr. Weiss said.\\nThe Met is also reviewing the possible sale of its executive apartment on Fifth Avenue; the previous director, Thomas P. Campbell, moved out this week. Mr. Weiss said the department heads are also continually evaluating their holdings for possible deaccession, for works that will not be displayed or have a distinct scholarly value, but that the Met’s acquisition spending would remain steady at about $50 million (most of the museum’s acquisitions come through gifts).\\nPhoto\\nThough the required admission for out-of-towners will result in a relatively modest revenue increase, Mr. Weiss said, “If every part operates a little bit better, we can get where we need to go.”\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nMr. Weiss emphasized that this change was not undertaken lightly and that the Met had evaluated several possible options, including mandatory admissions for everyone at a lower price point (“We felt an obligation to New Yorkers to not do that”) and charging for special exhibitions (“that would undermine access for New Yorkers”).\\nIf the museum did charge for special exhibitions, that might have forced the Met to chase revenue-producing exhibitions, something it wanted to avoid, Mr. Weiss said.\\nOn the cost side, the Met continues to look for savings, having already reduced staff and lowered the number of exhibitions annually from about 60 to 45.\\nThough the museum has tabled the planned transformation of its southwest wing dedicated to Modern and contemporary art — which Mr. Weiss said would have cost more than the previously projected $600 million — the Met is moving forward with evaluating a more modest renovation with the same architectural team, David Chipperfield and Beyer Blinder Belle. Mr. Weiss said it would cost more than $150 million less, but “there will be no compromise in quality.”\\n“We have the vision that drove the project in the first place,” he added, “but we’re looking at a project that is much more cost effective and compelling.”\\nMeanwhile, the Met has been making a concerted effort to improve internal communication and foster a working climate of transparency, Mr. Weiss said. He is reviewing spending with department heads on a regular basis, for example, and has created an ad hoc group of curators and conservators selected by their peers that “has access to everything related to the museum’s financial management.”\\n“There is no question that what we went through over the last couple of years heightened our awareness of getting things right,” Mr. Weiss added.\\nStill unresolved is the question of what to do about the Breuer building after the Met’s eight-year lease is up. “We’re very pleased with the programming, but it’s been more demanding a process and budget than we anticipated,” Mr. Weiss said. “We’re thinking very carefully about the Breuer long term.”\\nPhoto\\nThe Met’s search for a director is expected to conclude by the end of the fiscal year in June, said Mr. Weiss, who added that he is not a candidate for that job. Though the new director will report to Mr. Weiss under a recent leadership restructuring, he said he is confident that the Met is attracting top candidates, including women. “It’s the best museum leadership job in the world,” he said.\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nAsked to define the division of labor between himself and the next director, Mr. Weiss said: “It’s a partnership where the primary sphere of responsibility for the director is the content-related work — exhibitions, curators — including external relations and fund-raising. This person will be more visible than I will be.”\", \"The show’s honesty was also appealing to the cast of “The Chi.” “It’s not one of those shows that’s all glitz and glamour, all Skittles and quinoa,” Mr. Mitchell said. “It’s the real truth.”\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nHaving lost close friends to gun violence when growing up in New Orleans, the actor said appearing in the drama “was one of those times where it’s more therapy than acting.”\\nCommon, a fellow Chicago native who is an executive producer and one of the stars of “The Chi,” said Ms. Waithe stressed during filming how important it was for the show to pay homage to her city. “And so we’ve got a mission to be as authentic as we can,” he said.

Ms. Waithe said the topic was timely. She first noticed Hollywood was becoming more open-minded to racial diversity when, in early 2017, driving down Sunset Boulevard, in Los Angeles, she saw a towering billboard for the HBO comedy “Insecure,” starring the African-American actress Issa Rae.

Kim/Sun-Times\\nOutside the Morse el stop, where Trevillion was killed and the community meeting was held three days later.\\n\"The thing is that they don\\'t want to join because they\\'re afraid they\\'re going to be called \\'Uncle Toms,\\'\" Warner said. \"That has come from more than one black person that I have talked to. That is why we have such a low count of people of color, because they\\'re afraid they\\'re going to be profiled by their own people.\"\\nIt\\'s not \"your color I\\'m going after, it\\'s what you\\'re doing,\" Warner explained.\\n\"People hear \\'positive loitering,\\' and they think we\\'re going after black people because they\\'re the drug dealers and gangbangers. Wrong.\"\\nWhen asked what his group could do to change that perception, he said there was \"nothing we can do to help that, that\\'s their mindset.\"\\nThere was a shooting in my neighborhood, Rogers Park, in October. There were probably shootings in every neighborhood sometime this year, but this one attracted extra notice because the victim, Cynthia Trevillion, was a teacher at the local Waldorf School—she was on her way out to a Friday-night dinner with her husband and was unlucky enough to get caught in gang-related cross fire. The bullets hit her in the head and neck and she died immediately.The following Monday our alderman, Joe Moore, called a community meeting at the site of the shooting, the corner of Morse and Glenwood, next to the el stop. Reporters from DNAinfo and TV stations were there, but I went as a civilian, on my way home from work. Maybe 150 people showed up. Someone had set up a few rows of chairs in front of the stage, but most of us stood in the street and on the sidewalk. The sound system wasn\\'t good. We had to strain to hear.The alderman spoke, and then Glen Brooks, the police department\\'s director of public engagement, spoke, and then John Warner, the organizer of neighborhood \"positive loitering\" events, spoke. They all said Trevillion\\'s death had been a tragedy. They said that future tragedies might be prevented if everyone in the neighborhood put up a united front of \"vigilance\" by attending CAPS meetings and forming block clubs and positive loitering groups to show criminals that they weren\\'t welcome.On the surface, this all seemed reasonable. Yes, let the neighbors of Rogers Park come together to mourn the loss of one of our own and then vow to maintain a united front to protect our streets! Kumbaya!That\\'s how thingswork, but that\\'s not how Chicago worked in 2017. For one thing, it was the police who were making this request, and, if you\\'re black, as one-third of Rogers Park is, you have to wonder how much you can trust the police. (You even have to wonder this as a white person.) You wonder even if the representative the Chicago Police Department had sent to this particular meeting was black.Then there\\'s the perception that positive loitering is just another form of racial profiling, targeting people of color and assuming they don\\'t belong—even when the neighborhood is two-thirds people of color. Neighborhood policing is for white people.So by the third speech, lauding the virtues of community policing, a few members of the audience had enough. They had objections to the police department\\'s view of the world, and no one was letting them speak. So they shouted. They shouted about positive loitering. They shouted about the $95 million that was going to fund a new police academy when public schools were grossly underfunded. The speaker, Warner, the positive-loitering organizer, wasn\\'t used to hostile crowds. He began to falter.There was one young man who was especially loud. The cops who\\'d been standing behind the stage surrounded him and herded him down the street, away from the rally. A whole group of bystanders followed. We held up our cell phones to record, just in case the encounter went badly.That was another thing about living in America in 2017. You expected encounters between white police officers and young black men to go badly, and you knew that it was your duty as a citizen to bear witness.The protester asked the cops why he couldn\\'t speak his piece. A police officer told him he shouldn\\'t be interrupting. The protester asked why only the alderman and representatives of the police got to speak. The police officer said he didn\\'t know. They let the protester go.Back at the rally, Alderman Moore was urging everyone to sign up for community policing and block associations. There was a table set up on the sidewalk. A few members of the crowd, mostly older white people, were shoving to get close to it. The protesters kept shouting.Moore and Warner, who are both white, told DNAinfo\\'s Linze Rice the next day that it wasn\\'t their goal to alienate people of color. Instead, they wanted everyone to take a more active role in community policing.And it did indeed turn out to be true that the meeting did nothing to change anyone\\'s perception of community policing. There was supposed to be a period during the event when people who weren\\'t aldermen or police officers could come onstage to speak, Rice reported, but the organizers decided to skip over that altogether.Instead, a black pastor came up to say a final prayer. As he began to speak, a woman in the crowd shouted, \"Remember Laquan McDonald!\" The pastor raised his voice. The woman kept chanting. He got louder. So did she.And that was it: this was what it was like to live in Chicago in 2017, where everyone wanted the shooting to stop. The police thought they were doing a good thing by encouraging the people of the community to contribute to the overall safety of the neighborhood—when you have power and authority, people should accept your suggestions. They didn\\'t understand—or maybe they didn\\'t bother to acknowledge—that by squandering the people\\'s trust, they had also squandered their authority. Why should anyone listen to the police, even if it would be for their own good, when the police wouldn\\'t listen to the people they said they wanted to help? So here we are. And still the shootings continue.', \"We Can’t Arrest Our Way Out of Sex Trafficking Scourge\\nThey also report that each woman has sex with between 5 and 15 men a day.\\nThe women usually don’t speak much English, and many communicate with their clients via phone translation apps. To get and retain customers, the women or their pimps advertise a variety of kinky or exotic “experiences,” from pretending to be actual girlfriends of the client (the “GFE or girlfriend experience”) to nude “Nuru” massage.\\nOne of the pimps netted in a review board sting in 2015 admitted that many of the women were in debt bondage and in fear for their lives or the safety of their families.\\nPolice and prosecutors in the Seattle area began to focus on the prostitution “hobbyists” with a sting operation that targeted the operators of three online review boards on which up to 18,000 men rated and discussed a relatively small group of Korean women.\\nOn KGirlsDelight.com, for example, men assigned numerical ratings and added specific descriptions of the women, such as their sexual abilities, level of enthusiasm and other attributes. The site reportedly had 1.2 million monthly hits in 2009 (the last year its management publicly revealed numbers).\\nThe sting arrested 17 men and one woman, but only a director at Amazon and another director at Microsoft opted for a trial. The trial date has been repeatedly pushed back and is now scheduled for March 2018. None of the sex workers involved in those case were charged.\\nThe arrests angered libertarians and supporters of so-called sex workers who argue that most women sell sex by choice and that online review boards help keep women safe by providing a venue for warning women about dangerous men.\\nBut the Review Board’s comments display a lack of compassion at best, and at worst a pervasive contempt for women. One commenter who had bragged about chaining a woman to a radiator publicly lamented that two of his favorites were leaving Bellevue.\\nOne Seattle woman reviewed on the board, Alisa Bernard, spoke to ABC News this year. (She called herself a Seattle prostitution survivor turned activist.)\\xa0She got customers through the Review Board and believes review sites don’t make things safer for sex workers.\\n“There’s a perception of safety because there’s this, ‘Oh, well, you have to go through this board, and it’s online, and look how clean it is,’” Bernard said. “I had been raped multiple times. I was held against my will at least once. I was strangled, and these were all by Review Board guys so, you know, again, your line keeps getting pushed further and further and further to get those good reviews.”\\nOnline prostitution review boards are common in all major urban areas—they are the Yelp of the sex industry—but the Seattle boards were unusual in that men also gathered IRL (in real life, in tech parlance), calling themselves The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, to compare notes about the women over drinks in public venues, making it easy for Seattle police to infiltrate and secretly videotape some off the proceedings.\\n“She’s as close to perfect as I think they get made,” one man said, describing one of the Korean women.\\n“Right after K-girls, I’ve always had this thing for Eastern Europeans,” another said. “Like Czech, Hungarian, anyone from a war-torn country. Anything with ‘will work for food.’”\\nA day after Newsweek first contacted Microsoft for comment this week, an unknown number of Microsoft employees in Seattle received an email from Human Resources officials warning them: “Microsoft has been informed by the King County prosecutor’s office that they have obtained records in connection with a criminal enforcement activity related to a brother engaged in prostitution.”\\nThe Microsoft email informed recipients that law enforcement “may have obtained” business cards, badges and emails and links to a variety of company policies related to standards of business conduct and responsible use of technology. “You are urged to ensure that you have reviewed and complied with these company policies as well as criminal laws,” wrote a Microsoft human resources official named Adrienne Day.\\nA spokesman for Microsoft called the timing of the HR warning “coincidental” and denied it was related to the Newsweek investigation, although Microsoft had requested access to the records in October and received them in November, but only warned its employees this week.\\nAt a panel discussion on the issue in 2014, a King County prosecutor said the Seattle tech community is a major sex consumer—with the most frequent buyers middle- and upper-class white men. And a law enforcement source in Seattle told Newsweek that authorities know there is a concentration of buyers in tech, and that Seattle investigators have communicated with detectives in and around San Jose County, California, the jurisdiction that includes Silicon Valley.\\nA study conducted by Polaris, a leading anti-human trafficking organization, found that more than 700 Asian brothels (or “illicit massage parlors”) are based in Silicon Valley, 20 percent of the total number of brothels believed to be operating in California, although the area’s population is just one-tenth of the state’s total.\\nAccording to an ongoing study by the Organization of Prostitution Survivors in Seattle, reported on last year by a local news website, 63 percent of prostituted people said they met clients on company properties.\\nAlex Trouteaud, director of Policy and Research at Demand Abolition, another national anti-trafficking organization, said the tech sector is a “culture that has readily embraced trafficking.” As an example of the industry’s nonchalant attitude, he recalled that in its early days, Uber published a blog post that analyzed their data on ride sharing, focused on the Bay Area, and included people who were paying for prostitution. “They made a map using their ride-share data, like it was a funny thing they could do with their data. It was done so flippantly,” Trouteaud said.\\nJohn Tymczyszyn, a lawyer for some of the Microsoft employees who received the Microsoft warning this week, said his clients—who have not been charged and were not involved in the 2015 sting\\xa0but have been frequenting brothels whose computers authorities have seized—were alarmed. “I think anybody that received this email out of the blue would be, you know, scared that there would be career if not criminal repercussions,” he said.\\nTymczyszyn, who also represents other sex buyers in the Seattle area, questioned the judgement of men who used work emails from one of the most cyber-secure companies in the world to buy sex, but he says Seattle’s tech giants don’t conduct any sort of training to increase employees’ awareness about or compassion for trafficked women in brothels.\\nA spokesman for Microsoft emailed Newsweek the following statement: “Microsoft has a long history of cooperating with law enforcement and other agencies on combating sex trafficking and related topics, and we have employees who volunteer their time and money specifically to combat this issue as well. The personal conduct of a tiny fraction of our 125,000 employees does not in any way represent our culture. No organization is immune to the unfortunate situation when employees act unethically or illegally. When that happens, we look into the conduct and take appropriate action. Microsoft makes it clear to our employees they have a responsibility to act with integrity and conduct themselves in a legal and ethical manner at all times. If they don’t, they risk losing their jobs.”\\nThe tech sector’s many problems with women—from notoriously hostile workplaces and quotidian sexual harassment to CEOs with histories of violence against women—have been widely reported for years, including this Newsweek cover story.\\xa0 Newsweek\\nWhen Newsweek sought comment from Amazon this week, a spokeswoman first asked to see the emails sent by Amazon employees (unlike Microsoft, Amazon had apparently not requested the emails from authorities). Newsweek shared an Excel list with the senders’ names redacted, and when the spokeswoman said she couldn’t comment without seeing more, Newsweek emailed one full email.\\nToday, Amazon informed Newsweek that it is “investigating” the matter and provided this statement by email: “Amazon’s Owner’s Manual clearly states that, ‘It is against Amazon’s policy for any employee or Contingent Worker to engage in any sex buying activities of any kind in Amazon’s workplace or\\xa0in any work-related setting outside of the workplace, such as during business trips, business meetings or business-related social events.’ When Amazon suspects that an employee has used company funds or resources to engage in criminal conduct, the company will immediately investigate and take appropriate action up to and including termination. The company may also refer the matter to law enforcement.”\\nSeattle authorities broke up the review boards in 2015 but did not arrest the women rated on them. They have since disappeared from the Seattle area, according to Robert Beiser, executive director of Seattle Against Slavery, a volunteer organization that works with trafficked women.\\n“They were in debt and they tried to get out and they were afraid. In terms of where they have ended up, criminal enterprises stretch across countries, and can harm these people and their families, and the idea that they would disappear makes sense.”\\nBeiser added that Asian women are “a fetish for buyers.”\\nUpdate: This article has been updated with new information from a study.\\nChoose a Membership That's Perfect for You!\\nPrint & Digital\", \"They would not discuss the reasons for their departure in any more detail.

(Jessica Hill / Associated Press)\\nFive years ago today,\\nAdam Lanza\\nshot and killed his mother in Newtown, Conn., then took two semiautomatic handguns and a semiautomatic rifle from her cache of firearms to massacre 20 children and six staff members at\\nSandy Hook Elementary School\\n. Of course, people declared at the time, such a tragic, senseless event would be a turning point. Surely a slaughter of innocent children would be too much even for the\\nNational Rifle Assn.\\nand its adherents, and finally Congress would act to ban civilian possession of the guns of war.\\nNope. Since the Sandy Hook massacre, there have been five more mass shootings in which at least a dozen people were killed, and 15 other attacks in which at least four people died — for a total of 273 killed and 645 wounded, nearly all with legally obtained semiautomatic weapons. Even the horror of a heavily armed man raining bullets from the 32nd floor of Las Vegas\\' Mandalay Bay hotel in October into a packed concert site has not moved the needle on what this nation will tolerate.\\nAdvertisement\\nWe are at the sick juncture at which the mass murder of civilians with military-style weapons... has become part of our national identity.\\nShare quote & link\\nAt the moment, we are at the sick juncture at which the mass murder of civilians with military-style weapons not only no longer surprises, but has become part of our national identity. We even market the grief. You can walk down the Vegas Strip and find souvenir shops selling T-shirts with the slogan \"Vegas Strong,\" echoing the \"Boston Strong\" meme that cropped up following the marathon bombing in that city in 2013.\\nWhat then will it take? It is shameful that we do not force our elected representatives to act on this, and instead allow them to do the bidding of the powerful gun lobby and the companies that profit from this endless scourge of bloodletting. On average , 42 people are killed by guns (not including suicides) and 86 wounded a day.\\nToday, when we see breaking alerts of an active shooter, we immediately track the body count while ticking down a list of questions: Was it terrorism by some religious extremist, or — more often, such as the massacre last month of 26 people in a Texas church — the lashing out by a hate-filled American male? Were the guns bought legally? How about the background check? We drill down into the minutiae — how many firearms did he have? How many bullets fired? Were there are any warning signs that might, had they been picked up on, averted the tragedy?\\nSuch details are important, but the question that really needs to be answered is how such a wealthy, sophisticated country let itself get trapped in this cycle of madness. The body count includes children, parents, grandparents. Straight people. Gay people. Men. Women. White, black and Latino. All the ethnicities that compose America, and all shot dead going about their daily lives — school, work, church, play. These atrocities occur even as violent crime across the country has steadily declined for the last quarter of century.\\nThe country needs a saner approach. There is no reason for most Americans to possess weapons designed for war. There is no excuse for gun manufacturers who engineer their way around regulations (through bump-fire stocks like the one the Vegas gunman used to fire his semiautomatic rifles as though they were machine guns and \"bullet buttons\" that undercut a law intended to slow down mass shooters). Congress needs to mandate universal background checks with no carve-outs for private sales or other dodges. There needs to be a program for removing existing weapons from people who can\\'t be trusted with them.\\nThis is a public health crisis, but instead of responding, we let a strict interpretation of the 2nd Amendment guide our policy and we allow the NRA to define our political battles. We offer thoughts and prayers for the dead but nothing for the living so that they can escape a similar ending. We tolerate this state of affairs, which makes us all morally culpable for the slaughters of the future. We can\\'t keep on this way. We must do better.\\nFollow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion or Facebook\\nOpinion Newsletter', 'click to enlarge Ben Bowen\\nAndrew Bird (left) and his Specimen Products horn speakers at Fourth Presbyterian Church\\n\"Gezelligheid\" is a Dutch word for a feeling of coziness, a sense of loving belonging. Singer-songwriter Andrew Bird has adopted it as the name of his annual hometown performance series—a rare opportunity to see the Chicago expat in an intimate setting. The low lighting in the beautiful Fourth Presbyterian Church on Chestnut, where he\\'s held the shows for several years now, exudes an inviting warmth that blankets the tightly packed pews, which suddenly feel very far from the cold outside. The show I attended on Wednesday was like visiting family, and not just due to the uncomfortable proximity of other fans—the air buzzed with friendly conversation, and excited energy hovered above the well-dressed audience. Gezelligheid has grown into a special event all its own, a sold-out affair in an opulent but still welcoming hall. Opener Joan Shelley played lulling, tender folk music, her voice seeming especially quiet and unassuming in such a spectacular space. She was accompanied by Nathan Salsburg, a fellow resident of Louisville, Kentucky, who lent his fluid guitar to her recent self-titled album . The duo\\'s sleepy, bluegrass-tinged folk was an unexpected comfort, recalling Emmylou and Gram\\'s gentler moments. Between songs, Shelley stayed hushed, seeming almost shy—while the crowd applauded, she looked down and blushed, and she kept her banter to a muted minimum.When Bird took his turn onstage, he was like an eccentrically shaped puzzle piece fitting snugly into a background so idiosyncratic that almost anyone else would\\'ve looked out of place. Flanked with Seussian, Victrola-like speaker horns, designed by Ian Schneller of Chicago\\'s Specimen Products , he seemed to be presiding over a Wes Anderson-directed Grand Ole Opry. He mumbled rambling, funny stories to a (mostly) silent audience. In a big church. Surrounded by spinning horns and Christmas decorations. It was quaint, but quaintness defines Bird\\'s oeuvre—the multi-instrumentalist\\'s practiced blend of baroque pop and alt-country is comfortable and familiar in its affectations.Bird\\'s Gezelligheid performance found a balance between the luxurious, almost orchestral sound of his digitally layered violin and the old-fashioned down-home approach of three musicians sharing one microphone—an unpretentiousness that separated it from its ornate surroundings. The show felt friendly and private, even from 20 rows back, like an antique on display for the holidays. Bird and the talented troubadours supporting him offered magnificently stripped-down renditions of works from across his sizable repertoire, including a stirring performance of \"When the World\\'s on Fire,\" a religious folk song most famous in its Carter Family version. When Shelley joined them onstage for an encore, the feeling of gezelligheid reached its peak—a beautiful contentment like a reunion of old friends.Photographer Ben Bowen was on hand to shoot Wednesday\\'s show. Bird performs again tonight at Fourth Presbyterian with Shelley, then Friday at the Hideout with My Brightest Diamond.', 'Solo-ish\\nAnalysis\\nAnalysis Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events\\nWhy ‘Cat Person,’ a New Yorker short story, is essential reading for this #MeToo moment\\nby Lisa Bonos by Lisa Bonos Email the author December 12, 2017 Email the author\\n(Getty Images/iStock)\\nEven if you haven’t read the\\xa0New Yorker short story that went viral recently, you probably have an opinion about it.\\n“ Cat Person ” is Kristen Roupenian’s short story about a 20-year-old woman, Margot, who meets a 34-year-old man, Robert, at the artsy movie theater where Margot works at the concession stand. After some friendly banter, Robert gets her number. They proceed to text for a few weeks and go out on a date that leads to bad sex, after which Margot breaks it off via text. A\\xa0month later they see each other at a bar, and Robert later hurls misogynistic insults at her, also\\xa0via text, calling her a “whore.”\\nSo why is\\xa0a fictional story that’s\\xa0seemingly so mundane\\xa0becoming such a firestorm? Here are some reasons.\\nIt’s very much of the moment.\\xa0“It isn’t a story about rape or sexual harassment, but about the fine lines that get drawn in human interaction,” Deborah Treisman, the New Yorker’s fiction editor, tells\\xa0the Atlantic. \\xa0The fine lines between\\xa0a\\xa0friendly interaction and a flirtatious one, between an innocuous first date and a plot line from “Law and Order: SVU.”\\n“Cat Person” is not identical to the news stories\\xa0we’ve been\\xa0reading of\\xa0assault and harassment: Robert didn’t expose his penis to Margot outside the movie theater; he’s not her boss; he didn’t “force” her to do anything. But\\xa0Robert is older than Margot, as is the custom in heterosexual relationships,\\xa0calling most of\\xa0the shots in their interactions, and therefore\\xa0has the power in their fledgling relationship.\\xa0Similar\\xa0dynamics around power and sex are reflected in\\xa0nearly all of the stories of sexual assault and harassment in the workplace; and, as\\xa0“Cat Person” makes clear, those unbalanced power structures are present in courtship as well. Especially\\xa0in the Tinder era where casual, emotionally detached sex is\\xa0common. As Nancy Jo Sales, who wrote that blockbuster 2015 Vanity Fair article on “the dating apocalypse,”\\xa0 tweeted Sunday : “Basically anyone who’s ever used a dating app could write ‘Cat Person,’ just maybe not as well.”\\nMany women find it relatable. In an interview with the New York Times, Kristen Roupenian says “Cat Person” is not autobiographical, “though many of the details and emotional notes come from life, they were accumulated over decades, not drawn from a single bad date.”\\nOne passage in particular illustrates women’s\\xa0feelings about certain kinds of sexual encounters, especially those that can occur when two people barely know one another. As Margot and Robert get undressed at his place, she’s not incredibly attracted to him and ponders stopping the interaction, “but the thought of what it would take to stop what she had set in motion was overwhelming; it would require an amount of tact and gentleness that she felt was impossible to summon,” Rouhenian writes. “It wasn’t that she was scared he would try to force her to do something against her will but that insisting that they stop now, after everything she’d done to push this forward, would make her seem spoiled and capricious, as if she’d ordered something at a restaurant and then, once the food arrived, had changed her mind and sent it back.”\\nMargot’s hesitation\\xa0seems to come from a justifiable (and prophetic, as it turns out) fear of bad sex. Writer\\xa0Ella Dawson\\xa0echoes\\xa0many women’s reactions to the sex in “Cat Person”\\xa0in an essay on her blog \\xa0about “bad sex,” or\\xa0“the sex we don’t want but have anyway.” She\\xa0revisits the times in college she had this kind of sex, where\\xa0“no one forced anyone to participate. You could have said no and you didn’t. You didn’t have the words or you didn’t have the courage to say them,” Dawson writes, adding that\\xa0“too much of the time, bad sex is the norm for young women, not the exception.”\\nDawson thinks this dynamic is\\xa0partly due to sex education that stresses how women should avoid the risks inherent in sex — pregnancy, infection, assault — rather than teach them how\\xa0to enjoy it safely.\\xa0It’s a point that has come up in a lot of the interviews I’ve done recently as well, in which researchers note that there’s a perception that women are in control of their pleasure and their bodies, but they aren’t taught to ask for or expect it — while boys and men get the opposite message.\\nA woman enduring bad sex in her\\xa0personal life is linked to her not being able to escape it in other\\xa0settings.\\xa0Sara McClelland, an assistant professor of psychology and women’s studies who studies the concept of “intimate justice,” or how inequality shows up in sex, notes that “how people make demands at the intimate level is absolutely connected to how they make demands at the social and political level.” In women’s stories of sexual assault and harassment, McClelland sees women starting to make demands to be safe. “What people have said very smartly is: I didn’t have power to change this situation. If you don’t have economic power, you’re not able to make what we might think of as sort of intimate power exchanges with someone who’s being abusive.”\\n“Cat Person” gets at society’s changing\\xa0outlook on\\xa0consent.\\xa0Later, when Margot and Robert are\\xa0at his house, he’s calling the shots of how sex will go.\\xa0Margot may feel that\\xa0she was the one “push[ing] this forward” —\\xa0after he\\xa0offered to take her home because she’d been drinking, she pushed for more physical contact and asked to come over to his house.\\xa0But after that, Robert is clearly in control.\\nBefore our culture’s attention was focused so heavily on sexual assault and harassment in the workplace, the focus was on sexual assault on\\xa0college campuses — and developing new standards for consent. Robert, 34, is part of a cohort of men schooled in “no means no” — as in, he’ll consider a woman not interested if and when she tries to stop him. This\\xa0is decidedly different from how the 20-year-olds of today like Margot are taught to think about consent — as a “ yes means yes ” proposition where both parties affirmatively vocalize their consent and can revoke it at any time.\\nThe signs of Robert’s my-way-or-the-highway attitude begin long before they’re in the bedroom — he\\xa0courts Margot\\xa0in a series of demands,\\xa0starting with “concession-stand girl, give me your phone number”; progresses\\xa0to\\xa0“No, I’m serious, stop fooling around and come now,” for their 7-Eleven meetup; and once they’re hooking up, that mentality becomes “take that thing off” (her bra) and “yeah, yeah, you like that” when he slaps her thigh.\\nBut he never does ask what she likes or how she likes it; the entire interaction reads as if Robert is acting out a\\xa0masturbatory fantasy rather than interacting with a live human with her own desires. “During sex, he moved her through a series of positions with brusque efficiency, flipping her over, pushing her around, and she felt like a doll again, as she had outside the 7-Eleven, though not a precious one now — a doll made of rubber, flexible and resilient, a prop for the movie that was playing in his head,” Rouhenian writes.\\n“Cat Person” is in part about the shift\\xa0from a courtship model based on demands versus one based on questions and mutual understandings.\\xa0Similarly, the\\xa0#MeToo revelations could help shift men’s perspective on how their actions affect women in ways they might not immediately\\xa0discern.\\nSome men don’t find “Cat Person” relatable.\\xa0The Twitter feed @MenCatPerson \\xa0is\\xa0broadcasting men’s\\xa0reaction to the story, many of whom don’t understand how women could relate to the story \\xa0or\\xa0think Robert was the “victim” of the story , seeing his misogynistic rant against Margot\\xa0as justified.\\xa0All of which further proves why we need to continue listening to women’s stories about sex — especially of the times they didn’t feel they could say no. That might help\\xa0empower women to say yes to the kind of sex they want and no to the sex they don’t.\\xa0All without being called a “whore.”\\nRead more:', 'Students in gym class at Mildred I. Lavizzo Elementary School in Chicago. “Whatever kids come in here, we know we can grow them,” the school’s principal, Tracey Stelly, says. Lyndon French for The New York Times\\nCHICAGO — In the Chicago Public Schools system, enrollment has been declining, the budget is seldom enough, and three in four children come from low-income homes, a profile that would seemingly consign the district to low expectations. But students here appear to be learning faster than those in almost every other school system in the country, according to new data from researchers at Stanford.\\nThe data, based on some 300 million elementary-school test scores across more than 11,000 school districts, tweaks conventional wisdom in many ways. Some urban and Southern districts are doing better than data typically suggests. Some wealthy ones don’t look that effective. Many poor school systems do.\\nThis picture, and Chicago’s place in it, defy how we typically think about wealth and education in America. It’s true that children in prosperous districts tend to test well, while children in poorer districts on average score lower. But in this analysis, which measures how scores grow as student cohorts move through school, the Stanford researcher Sean Reardon argues that it’s possible to separate some of the advantages of socioeconomics from what’s actually happening in schools.\\nIn Chicago, third graders collectively test below the second-grade level on reading and math. But this data shows that over the next five years, they receive the equivalent of six years of education. By the eighth grade, their scores have nearly caught up to the national average:\\nTest scores for 3rd graders in 2,000 large school districts. ← Poorer districts Richer districts → Now see 8th grade …\\nBy comparison, children in the Milwaukee Public Schools test at similarly low rates in the third grade but advance more slowly, leaving them even further behind by the eighth grade. In Maryland’s Anne Arundel County, third graders test above the national average. But growth there lags behind Chicago, where the poverty rate is about five times higher.\\nAcross the country, this analysis shows, the wealth of a district tells us little about the effectiveness of its schools.\\nChange in test scores between 3rd grade and 8th grade ← Poorer districts Richer districts →\\n“One question we’ve been asking ourselves is: Do urban public school systems simply reflect the poverty of the kids in the schools, or do they overcome those effects to any degree?” said Michael Casserly, the executive director of the Council of the Great City Schools, which represents large urban districts.\\nThis new data shows that many do overcome them. It also suggests that states that rate schools and select which ones to reward or shutter based on average test scores are using the wrong metric, Mr. Reardon argues. And so are parents who rely on publicly available test scores to identify what they believe are the best school districts — and so the best places to live.\\n“Most people think there’s some signal in that,” Mr. Reardon, a professor of education, said of average test scores. “But it’s a pretty bad signal.”\\nStandardized tests, he acknowledges, are an incomplete measure of educational success, and some places like the state of Massachusetts have tried to include measures of growth in evaluating teachers and schools because of the limitations that Mr. Reardon points to.\\nEven the Chicago Teachers Union, however, warns that standardized tests don’t measure the richness of a curriculum, or whether students have access to librarians and college counselors. Mr. Reardon’s data also can’t detect when changes occur because students leave or enter a district between third and eighth grade. So demographic change may affect growth rates in a place like Anne Arundel, which has experienced an influx of children who are still learning English.\\nEducators have long debated whether it’s better to evaluate students and schools on proficiency levels or growth rates. Mr. Reardon’s data makes possible a national database of both. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 required states to conduct their own assessments in reading and math. This analysis converts those state scores, from 2009 to 2015, into a common standard measured in grade levels.\\nDistricts with high growth are scattered across the country, in contrast with sharp geographic divisions on proficiency that show Northern schools ahead of those in the Deep South. School systems across Arizona and Tennessee that appear to test well below national averages are in fact overperforming in growth. Many predominantly minority districts where third graders start behind have high growth rates. But in New York City, where third graders test at the national average, slow growth puts them at a disadvantage later.\\nHighest growth rates School district Growth after 5 years Lowest growth rates School district Growth after 5 years Among the 200 largest school districts.\\nEven the fastest growth rates Mr. Reardon measures couldn’t completely close the proficiency gap that exists early on between typical poor and wealthy districts. That suggests that the most effective school systems alone can’t overcome all the disadvantages of poverty that accumulate before children even reach third grade and that shape the country’s racial achievement gaps.\\nThere is promise, however, in a place like Chicago.\\n“Here’s the third-biggest school system in the country that’s dramatically outperforming not just the other big poor districts, but almost every district in the country, at scale,” Mr. Reardon said. If we understood what was causing that, in Chicago and other disadvantaged but high-growth districts, that might help reduce educational inequality, he said.\\nLavizzo Elementary School in Chicago serves a student population that’s 98 percent black and 93 percent low income. Lyndon French for The New York Times\\nEven within this city, there’s broad disbelief in good news about the schools, in how they could succeed amid perpetual budget cuts, contentious school closings, rising crime and financial crisis.\\nBut Mr. Reardon finds no evidence of inflated test scores in the district (by contrast, the recent cheating scandal in Atlanta is apparent in his data). Researchers at the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Chicago have also pointed to positive results for Chicago, relative to the rest of Illinois, and using other metrics.\\n“At some point, you’ve got to say, ‘O.K., this is getting to be an accurate picture,’ ” Mayor Rahm Emanuel said. The district has come far from 30 years ago, Mr. Emanuel notes, when Education Secretary William Bennett described the city’s schools as the worst in the country.\\n“I do wonder, if our students were not predominantly minority and poor, would people have the same level of skepticism?” said Janice Jackson, the district’s chief education officer since 2015 and a former teacher and principal in the system. “In public education we talk all the time about ‘beating the odds,’ about public education as ‘the great equalizer.’ But when we see it happen, we question it.”\\nComputer class at Lavizzo Elementary School on the far South Side of Chicago. Lyndon French for The New York Times\\nMr. Reardon’s data shows that every demographic group within the district is growing at rates well above the national average, with Hispanic students outpacing whites. But while growth is broadly distributed, the pattern in Chicago and across the country means that black-white achievement gaps aren’t narrowing much even in the districts with the strongest growth.\\nOn the city’s far South Side, scores have risen at Mildred I. Lavizzo Elementary School, which serves a student population that’s nearly 98 percent black and 93 percent low income. Several homes across the street are boarded up, and the area has lost population and jobs. Inside the school, the halls are decorated with emblems of other places: college banners, foreign flags, clocks that tell the time in Nairobi and Dublin.\\nTracey Stelly, the principal since 2009, has brought in every enhancement she can find. The school uses an International Baccalaureate curriculum. The students read the Junior Great Books. The school hosts a community farmer’s market. Outside groups lead choir classes and organized games at recess.\\n“Whatever kids come in here, we know we can grow them,” Ms. Stelly said. She peered into the gymnasium one afternoon this fall while the fifth graders were dancing with their teachers to celebrate a schoolwide fund-raising project. “When kids come in the building,” she said, “they know, ‘This is where I belong.’ ”\\nAt Lavizzo, the district’s emphasis on data and performance tracking is also conveyed to students in a manner Ms. Stelly hopes will inspire competition while remaining playful. One first-floor bulletin board updates the school’s attendance targets. Another records goals that students have set for their standardized test scores.\\nAcross the district, data about attendance and grades is being used to identify the students likely to need extra attention. And the district has emphasized the role of more autonomous principals in improving instruction, an element of reform that Mr. Emanuel said is underappreciated nationally in debates that more often focus on teachers.\\nStudents at Chicago’s Lavizzo Elementary School learn an International Baccalaureate curriculum. Lyndon French for The New York Times\\nThe mayor has pushed other changes, including a longer school day and expanded pre-K, but those policies have shifted too recently to explain all the gains in Mr. Reardon’s data. Mr. Casserly suggests that Chicago and other large urban districts have been focused for years on the quieter work of defining what “grade level” actually means and how to get children there.\\nBetween all these changes, it’s hard to untangle what’s been most effective, said Elaine Allensworth, who leads an education research consortium at the University of Chicago that works with the district.

Samuels / Factor Artists; models Caitlin, Mana, and Cam\\nLooking at clothes is a form of time travel. In museum exhibits especially, where the clothes hang on headless mannequins, it\\'s entirely up to you to imagine the sort of woman who wore the narrow-skirted riding habit in 1880, or the man who wore the elaborately embroidered silk dressing gown—a banyan—in 1822, or maybe the girl who found it in the attic in 1910 and decided to appropriate it as her own. Or you can imagine yourself as all those people. How did it feel to lace your body into a corset every day and only be able to ride a horse sidesaddle? Did it make you feel weak and helpless? Or did the extra layer of support make you feel protected, like armor? Conversely, how did it feel to wear big leather boots and an enormous frock coat? Did it make you feel like the entire world belonged to you? Sometimes when I look at those clothes, I want a big pair of boots and an enormous frock coat too, and maybe a hidden layer of armor as long as it doesn\\'t hurt. I want to stride through the world, tall and terrible, and stomp on anyone—any man—who gets in my way with his groping hands or his belittling comments or his offer of 80 cents for my work when he would offer another man a dollar. I like looking at new clothes too, in department stores and online. It\\'s another way to imagine a different version of yourself. There are a lot of new companies that exist only online, and this year they\\'ve all started popping up in my Facebook feed: Everlane, Cuyana, Frilly, Toast. Somehow they\\'d gotten the message that I—and apparently every woman who shared my demographic profile—wanted to be tall and terrible in ways that skinny jeans and crop tops don\\'t allow. There were wide-legged pants and long, sweeping coats and tall leather boots and a cape. Once I even saw chain mail. And one time I saw a virtual replica of my favorite sweater of all time, a baggy crewneck made of navy blue heathered wool that I wore from eighth grade through the end of college—when the elbows finally unraveled—and which always reminded me of one of the periods in my life when I felt most like myself. All summer long, on the train and on the street, I saw young women in their 20s wearing knee-length dresses that looked like enormous T-shirts, a look that announced, \"You don\\'t get to ogle my boobs. And if you don\\'t like it, fuck you.\" In the New York Times, the fashion critic Vanessa Friedman declared that the covered-up look was the style of the decade. \"It\\'s not about power dressing in the old, battering-ram-shoulder sense,\" she wrote, \"but in the sense that when you feel secure and comfortable and protected, you feel stronger.\" Did we not want to feel strong and secure before? I wanted to blame the shift to power dressing on the rage that had overtaken the women of America after Donald Trump was elected president. \"Changes in fundamental modes of dress,\" the sociologists George Bush and Perry London wrote in the Journal of Social Psychology back in 1960, \"indicate changes in social roles and self-concepts of members of that society.\" But when I started asking fashion designers and historians about this, they told me that bigger clothes had first shown up on the runways about three years ago, even if it had taken a while for the look to filter down to the average woman on the el. It\\'s true that fashion is cyclical. A period of tight clothes will be followed by a period of looser clothes, just because the general public—though maybe not specific individuals—is always looking for an excuse to refresh its collective wardrobe. And fashion designers have begun to realize that there\\'s an enormous market for modest clothing, especially in Islamic countries. But we don\\'t have to embrace everything the fashion designers throw at us. And maybe we were angry when the bigger clothes first showed up and hadn\\'t realized it? What was going on?\\nPetya Shalamanova\\nOne thing designers are really great at is tapping into the zeitgeist before the general population does,\" Jamie Hayes, a Chicago designer, told me. \"We feel things in the collective unconscious. Sometimes those things come out as overt political statements, and sometimes more unconsciously.\" We sat at a worktable in the front room of Hayes\\'s studio in Logan Square, which she shares with Gerry Quinton, a corset maker. The space also functions as a showroom for Hayes\\'s clothing line Production Mode, Quinton\\'s corset label Morua, and Department of Curiosities, the lingerie brand they work on together; their supplies and collection of vintage sewing machines live in the back. Hayes was wearing a pair of wide-legged trousers she\\'d made herself: \"My legs can breathe!\" Hayes\\'s latest collection for Production Mode, which she unveiled in July, features lots of heavy fabrics and boxy cuts. This was, in part, because she wanted to wear clothes that felt warm and heavy and comforting but also strong and tough. \"These are anxiety-producing times,\" she explained. \"I wanted a blanket. Cloth is the first thing that replaces your mother: a security blanket or a teddy bear, soft tactile things that make you feel safe. I wanted that feeling in a way I haven\\'t wanted it for some time.\" The clothes had a boxy shape for a practical reason too: the fabric she\\'d been using had been custom-made by the Weaving Mill, a textile studio in Chicago, in collaboration with the artist Nuria Montiel. It was beautiful and expensive, a labor of love, and she didn\\'t want to waste any of it by cutting out intricate shapes. Instead, she used simple rectangles to create robes and tunics. The clothes had a gender-neutral aspect that she liked, like kaftans and kimonos and other traditional garments that had been worn for centuries. \"If you go back far enough,\" she said, \"everyone was wearing a dress.\" The fashion historian Valerie Steele wrote in Men and Women: Dressing the Part, \"There is rarely a single meaning attached to each article of clothing. Instead, its meanings depend on the context—Who wears it? When? Along with what other clothes? What was the history of this garment? . . . The sociologist Fred Davis suggests that at various times in history certain social ambivalences become prominent and may be expressed sartorially.\" A few months earlier, I\\'d seen a notice about a lecture given by the Rational Dress Society, which consists of two artists, Abigail Glaum-Lathbury and Maura Brewer. The RDS was founded in 2014, and its main project is a unisex jumpsuit, designed by Glaum-Lathbury and Brewer, that can be worn by anyone on any occasion. It comes in 248 different sizes, based on individual measurements and body type and whether the wearer wants it fitted in the chest or not. (Each size has a delightfully random name, like \"quark\" or \"ooloi\" or \"jairzinho.\") Though production is stalled on the jumpsuit at the moment, Brewer and Glaum-Lathbury plan to resume taking orders in the near future. They also plan to make the pattern available as an open-source document so anyone with sewing skills can create their own jumpsuit. This isn\\'t a new idea, they told me when we talked. We were skyping; Glaum-Lathbury was in Chicago and Brewer was in LA, and both of them were wearing jumpsuits, as they do every day. \"We didn\\'t want to act like our idea was the first time anyone had ever done this,\" Brewer said. \"It\\'s important for us to establish our relationship to other artists and designers who used clothes to think through social change.\" The history of protest fashion, or antifashion, began during the French Revolution, when the revolutionaries rejected the knee breeches of the aristocracy and began wearing long pants in solidarity with the peasants. They called themselves the sans culottes. Nearly a century later, in 1881, the original Rational Dress Society was founded in England and dedicated to the proposition that no woman should have to wear more than seven pounds of undergarments at one time. Society members distributed pamphlets that showed the difference between the Venus de Milo, with an ideal \"natural\" body, and a contemporary woman whose body had been \"deformed\" by a corset. They focused most of their efforts on women\\'s clothes because, in its founders\\' opinion, men\\'s dress—having permanently adopted the long pants of the sans culottes—already was rational. Brewer and Glaum-Lathbury\\'s jumpsuit was inspired by the TuTa, a costume developed by Italian futurists just after World War I as a protest against having to buy a complete wardrobe in a precarious economy. Like the Rational Dress Society jumpsuit, the TuTa was intended to be worn by all people on all occasions, thereby obliterating class differences, and the pattern was available to everyone. Unlike the jumpsuit, the TuTa was gendered: the male version had pants, while the female had a skirt. Brewer and Glaum-Lathbury think their jumpsuit is aesthetically pleasing—they like its long, clean lines and futuristic look—but it too is a protest. \"It was motivated by a desire to have a critical conversation within the space of fashion design about the way clothes are produced and disseminated,\" Brewer said. \"Fast fashion is a relatively recent phenomenon, and it\\'s a human rights and environmental disaster,\" she said of the business model exemplified by retailers such as H&M and Zara, which quickly manufacture and push to market styles that mirror runway trends. \"People are able to buy massive amounts of cheap clothes that are made in sweatshops and are bad for the environment. I don\\'t think it makes anyone happy, but it\\'s addictive, a hit of adrenaline. The clothes are meant to last ten wash cycles.\" \"When was the last time you stared into your closet and said, \\'I have nothing to wear\\'?\" Glaum-Lathbury added. \"What are the problems? Your clothing isn\\'t signifying what you want it to signify. People are going into Forever 21 and thinking they\\'re expressing themselves through clothing, when really it\\'s Forever 21 expressing themselves through you.\" After Donald Trump was elected president, the Rational Dress Society connected its work more overtly to electoral politics. Both Trump and his daughter Ivanka, Brewer and Glaum-Lathbury felt, epitomized the problems with the fast-fashion industry: in their stump speeches, they urged people to buy American, but they put their names on clothing that was manufactured as cheaply as possible in sweatshops in China and Bangladesh and Mexico. The garments themselves were made out of polyester and other synthetics that would just sit in a landfill forever. So they started an adjunct project for the Rational Dress Society: Make America Rational Again. They\\'ve issued a request for the women of America to send them their used Ivanka Trump-brand clothing, which they will recycle into special-edition jumpsuits, millennial pink with gold accents. The project received a fair amount of media attention and the initial response, they told the Huffington Post a few days after the project launched, was \"tremendous! Huge!\" They\\'ve also been collecting clothes on their own, in thrift stores and used clothing piles and on resale sites like Thredup (which, Racked reported, saw its listings of Ivanka Trump merchandise increase by 223 percent in 2016). \"Professional women noticed that these clothes had been in their wardrobe,\" Glaum-Lathbury theorized when we talked. \"It was a thing that needed to be purged immediately from their homes and their bodies.\" Now phase two, the recycling, is under way. They plan to work with the Weaving Mill, the same collective that made Jamie Hayes\\'s fabrics, and they\\'ve been raising funds by selling tote bags and special-edition posters printed on paper recycled from Ivanka Trump\\'s books. (The promo video shows Glaum-Lathbury smiling beatifically as she feeds a copy of Women Who Work through a buzz saw.) Since the Rational Dress Society is rooted as much in the art world as it is in the fashion world, the Make America Rational Again campaign exists as much to make a point as it does to create recycled millennial pink jumpsuits—though those would be nice too, and so would profits, which they intend to donate to the Garment Workers Center in LA, the only garment workers\\' advocacy organization in the entire country. Rational Dress, to Brewer and Glaum- Lathbury, is really about democracy and equality, not just equality in terms of style, but equality for the people who make the clothes. Which, ironically enough, is the same line fast-fashion companies use to sell their designer knockoffs. \"Democracy is agency and inclusion and an ability to have an active voice in something,\" Glaum-Lathbury said. \"What you have at the end of buying a Peter Pilotto for Target sweater is less money and an ugly sweater that\\'s a facsimile of something else that\\'s going to fall apart. How is that democratic?\"\\nRational Dress Society produces a unisex jumpsuit that comes in 248 different sizes.\\nLara Kastner\\nIn order to learn more about clothing democracy and protest fashion, I went to the library, or rather the Fashion Resource Center at the School of the Art Institute. It\\'s a wondrous place, with one room filled with books and a century\\'s worth of fashion magazines and a second room, equally large, packed with vintage clothes, organized by designer. It feels like the world\\'s most fabulous closet—or it would if you were allowed to wear any of those clothes, which you are not. During one of my visits, a professor spent some time instructing her class on how to fit a garment onto a display mannequin without ripping it. Alex Aubry, the director of the Fashion Resource Center, had pulled a pile of books for me to look at. He also gave me a Post-it note to stick on my laptop that read, \"Identity by definition is protest.\" \"The relationship between clothing and identity becomes even more complicated in the context of a younger generation that doesn\\'t necessarily want to be placed into a neat box, because their sense of being is both complex and nuanced,\" he told me. \"As a universal medium, fashion can play a role in engaging in these larger conversations surrounding identity today because everyone can relate to clothing on some level.\" One of the books Aubry had given me, Chic Thrills: A Fashion Reader, contained an account by an art historian named Kate Luck of fashion in the various utopian communities that sprung up in America in the 1820s. Most of these communities had been founded by men, who established the ideology and rules, which usually involved abdication of personal property and sharing of the labor and profits. (Somehow, though, the women still were in charge of all the housework.) Some of them also established dress codes that, for women, required a knee-length skirt over a loose pair of trousers. John Humphrey Noyes, the founder of the Oneida community, thought that this costume would make women more like men and protect them both from sexual assault and from displaying the sort of excessively feminine behavior that women use to attract husbands. In Oneida, everyone practiced free love (and also birth control). The women of Oneida hated their costume. It made them conspicuous as members of the colony. When outsiders looked at them, they didn\\'t think about the beauty of communal living. Instead they just thought about free love and how every woman who lived there must be slutty. Maybe the women also resented that the costume was a sign of how Noyes considered them inferior to men, and that he needed to \"elevate\" them by making them wear a ridiculous variation on men\\'s clothing. About 30 years later, Amelia Jenks Bloomer, an early feminist, began wearing a knee-length skirt over loose trousers gathered at the ankle, also known as \"Turkish dress.\" (A name so evocative of the harem couldn\\'t have helped its popularity much.) \"When you find a burden in belief or apparel,\" she declared, \"cast it off.\" But even people who favored dress reform thought the costume looked ridiculous, and it never caught on; within five years, Bloomer herself returned to wearing conventional skirts. In the 1890s, though, the loose trousers, now referred to as a \"divided skirt,\" came back yet again (though without the overskirt), and this time they were embraced. Sort of. Women found them useful for riding bicycles and playing sports. But when they weren\\'t exercising, they went back to regular dresses, corsets and all. It seemed to me that they finally accepted the divided skirt because they could choose whether they wanted to wear it, and they did only when it served the practical function of letting them move more freely.\\nGerry Quinton’s label, Morua, produces corsets.\\nPetya Shalamanova\\nOne of the beauties of modern fashion is that it\\'s no longer controlled by an elite group of designers, stylists, and magazine editors—or chauvinistic utopian philosophers. Since the mid-20th century, designers have been taking their inspiration—or stealing—from street fashion, but now with the Internet, the parade of new styles is constant and never-ending. Instead of two distinct seasons, spring and fall, stores roll out new items every week. Manufacturers have resorted to using cheap materials and cheaper labor not just out of greed, like the Trumps, but to keep up with demand. This is what led to the fast fashion that the Rational Dress Society is protesting. This is also why H&M and Forever 21 smell like plastic and why I feel depressed every time I try to spend any time there. But while the Rational Dress Society jumpsuit is definitely a, yes, rational alternative, I also feel it will never be adopted wholeheartedly by the people of America, despite its accurate fit, fair labor practices, and commitment to gender equality. I personally don\\'t want to wear it, at least not every day. (I\\'ve always disliked clothing that shows off my butt.) It feels too absolutist. Or maybe I feel that way because it would force me to conform to someone else\\'s vision. A few years ago, I read an interview with Michele Oka Doner, a sculptor who has worn variations on the same dress every day for more than 30 years. She started with just one dress, in white. \"When I would go to get dressed,\" she said, \"over and over again it was what I wanted to wear. And over the next five, six, ten years, this was the go-to dress that made me feel so comfortable I never had to think about how I was going to look or what to wear with it.\" So she asked designers and tailors to make copies for her in different lengths and fabrics, sometimes with pockets. Now she has 40 of them. There\\'s a German word for this (of course there is): Eigenkleid, or individualized dress. Josef Hoffmann, an Austrian architect, designer, and proponent of dress reform, argued in an essay in 1898 that women would be both happier and healthier if they rejected fashion altogether and adopted personalized dresses that were suited to their individualized tastes and bodies. How wonderful it would be to have an eigenkleid that suited me perfectly! How wonderful to be like Doner and have such a secure sense of style and self and maybe the state of the world to be able to identify your eigenkleid and never waver from it. But I think most of us aren\\'t so secure. Or we\\'re like Jamie Hayes, who did a project a few years ago designing two-dozen eigenkleider for herself and friends and colleagues. Hayes\\'s own uniform was a Chinese qipao dress inspired by the movie In the Mood for Love. But she couldn\\'t bring herself to wear it every day. \"I found I love clothes too much to wear just one thing,\" she said. And her mood has changed in the five years since she created her uniform. \"Traditionally I\\'ve worn lots of dresses,\" she said. \"They work with my body type. Lately I find myself not wanting to wear them. I don\\'t want to look like anyone\\'s little girl right now.\" This reminded me of Hillary Clinton\\'s pantsuits, perhaps the most famous eigenkleid in modern history. \"They made me feel professional and ready to go,\" she writes in her memoir What Happened. \"As a woman running for President, I liked the visual cue that I was different from the men but also familiar. A uniform was also an antidistraction technique: since there wasn\\'t much to say or report on what I wore, maybe people would focus on what I was saying instead.\" Ha.\\nUniversal Standard makes clothes that are flattering and elegant, but most importantly, in sizes that have been traditionally ignored by most designers.\\nShane LaVancher\\nThe Universal Standard clothing line is a bit of an outlier in the history of protest fashion. Alexandra Waldman didn\\'t start making clothes because of any political philosophy or theory. She started for the simple reason that, as a size-18 woman, she couldn\\'t find a damned thing to wear. In Tokyo, where she lived for seven years, plus-size clothing doesn\\'t exist. She got around the problem by buying men\\'s clothes and hacking off collars and buttons and playing with the fit until she came up with something wearable. When she moved back to Manhattan, she thought things would be better. They were not. Her friend Polina Veksler, who wears single-digit sizes, didn\\'t believe it could be that bad. So Waldman took Veksler to the plus-size corner of what she\\'ll only identify as \"a famous department store.\" \"Welcome,\" she said, \"to my corner of polyester hell.\" Veksler looked at the selection of tent dresses, many covered with sequins, bows, and hideous prints. \"This cannot be it,\" she said. \"It can,\" Waldman replied, \"and it is.\" Right then, the two friends decided to start their own business producing clothes that were flattering, elegant, well made, easy to wear, and all in sizes that have traditionally been ignored by most designers. Waldman would be in charge of design, while Veksler would handle the financials. They started with eight pieces in sizes ten to 28, a small wardrobe of shirts and sweaters, a skirt, and a dress that could be combined into 20 different outfits. In the two years since they\\'ve added many more pieces, including jeans and winter coats. They also plan to expand their size range in both directions. The clothes are made mostly of Peruvian cotton and are produced in factories that Waldman and Veksler have actually visited. They\\'re designed not to stretch or pill or fall apart in the wash, and they\\'re sized to accommodate a wide range of body types. A basic T-shirt costs $50, which is a lot compared to a fast-fashion outlet, but about the same as a similar shirt produced by Cuyana, a similarly ethically conscious online-only company that doesn\\'t make anything larger than size 12. (The Universal Standard shopper is a woman who, like Waldman, has a solid income and not enough clothes to spend it on. Even if she were a size two, she wouldn\\'t be shopping at H&M.) I met Waldman and Veksler on the fourth floor of Nordstrom Michigan Avenue, where Universal Standard had a pop-up shop the last weekend in October. They were in the middle of a cross-country tour and had lost track of the number of cities they\\'d visited. Veksler was eight months pregnant. Part of our conversation took place in the women\\'s lounge, which seemed to emphasize an important point about women and anger: most of our venting happens in the bathroom. \"A lot of women are chronically underserved and discarded, in terms of style,\" Waldman told me. \"They\\'re not allowed to participate. The message they get is, if you like fashion, don\\'t be fat!\" According to a 2012 study by Plunkett Research, a market research firm, 67 percent of American women are size 14 or larger. And yet, according to a Bloomberg study, department stores devote less than 18 percent of their stock to plus-size women. (Nordstrom allows about only 8.5 percent.) \"There\\'s a lot of rage,\" Waldman said. \"The tide is turning. Women accepted what was given before. But now they\\'re saying, \\'It\\'s not my fault. It\\'s your fault I don\\'t have clothes.\\'\" But despite Universal Standard\\'s wide range of offerings, its endorsements by plus-size models (who, in one of the company\\'s initiatives, get to design three pieces of clothing they always wanted but could never find in their size), and the ego boost that comes from being labeled a small instead of an extralarge, Waldman and Veksler have still seen women come into their showrooms in New York and Seattle, look at their reflections in the mirror, and break down crying, either out of sadness or rage or a combination of the two. \"They\\'re not seeing what\\'s there,\" Waldman explained. \"They want to see a better self. They say, \\'I\\'m a 20 now, but I started a vegan diet yesterday and yoga the day before that, so this is a temporary state, and I\\'m going to get rid of it.\\' It\\'s like living with a bully in your head.\" Which is something else women are fighting whenever they put on clothes, no matter what size they are. Universal Standard is doing its best. It makes a deal with its customers: if they buy anything from a list of 21 items and change sizes over the course of a year, they can trade that piece in for an identical one in the new size. The used clothes will be donated to Dress for Success, a charity that provides work clothes for impoverished women and has a shortage of plus-size items. But sometimes I would like to fight back against that bully, which I imagine to be the internalized voice of both fashion magazines and the sort of men who watch women and assign them numbers based on their looks. Maybe I could wear a robe that hangs from my shoulders so nobody can see what my body looks like. Nobody could tell how big my breasts are or if my stomach sticks out or my ass is the right shape, and nobody would look at me and make assumptions or judgments about my intelligence or lack thereof. I could just live. Then I remember how this was the strategy I used to get through grad school. I wore jeans and baggy T-shirts (which weren\\'t fashionable then; this was the era of the belly shirt) and cut my hair short and switched from contacts to glasses. People told me I looked like Harry Potter. For some reason, I thought my male professors—and all but one of them were male—would respect my intelligence more if I were genderless. I don\\'t know if they actually did, but I do know that I was one of the few women in my class they never propositioned. A few years later, after I graduated, I grew my hair out and got a job where I had to dress nicely, and then I faced all the grossness that comes with being female again: the condescension, the close talking, the hands going where they have no business going. It was interesting to me that when I started interviewing people for this story, every woman understood exactly what I meant when I asked them if they felt there was more of a connection now between our collective anger and the clothes we\\'re choosing to wear. They had no proof that this connection existed, that this was how we were conveying our anger. There\\'s been no well-reasoned manifesto or call to arms, as there was for past antifashion movements. But they all felt it. \"Clothing can act as a powerful tool for protection physically and psychologically,\" said Petra Slinkard, the curator of costumes at the Chicago History Museum. \"I think of clothing like armor. When I wear a blazer, it\\'s like going into battle.\"\\nPetya Shalamanova', \"I am not a fan of suicide, but if I could crawl into the chocolate churro souffle at Regards to Edith I would joyfully eat myself to death. With no regrets, I'd happily gaze down on the runner who snatches the plate away, delivering my remains to the dishwasher, who then blasts what's left of me down the drain with a howitzer of hot steaming water. But more about this outstanding dessert later.\\nHeisler Hospitality's 12th joint is on the first floor of the erstwhile Cold Storage building, now the home of Google's Chicago HQ. According to the restaurant's backstory, the mysterious Edith in question is the addressee on an old photograph of Chicago heavyweight boxer Kingfish Levinsky, which would've been cool to see blown up and hung on the wall somewhere. It's the wish of every dreamer in town right now to open a restaurant in the Fulton Market District, a neighborhood so popular it's killing its own rapidly diminishing industrial charm.\\nAt Regards to Edith raw brick walls and a pitch-black exposed ceiling are the only things remotely evocative of the space's industrial history. Add to those a few towering green plants and from certain angles Regards to Edith feels a bit like a fern bar. Not that there's anything wrong with that.\\nOn the other hand, the menu, developed by Jared Wentworth (who's since left the company), nods toward a rougher Chicago. As executed by his successor, former chef de cuisine Eric Michael, it features gussied-up makeovers of classic hometown foods. Some of these are listed under a category called Brown Paper, presumably because you're so fancy you can only eat them with your head inside a bag. A shaved prime-rib sandwich wearing a thin Italian-beef disguise features thickly sliced (relative to real Italian beef) cow showered with uniformly diced, delicately oiled giardiniera (a variant that previously could not have existed in this dimension), and a small pitcher of Italian beef jus, to apply to your own specific taste. It's a perfectly good beef sandwich, but I'm glad the decision was made not to call it an Italian beef (especially at $19).\\nThere's also a pizza puff on the menu. Ew, right? Hold on now, this one is nothing like those previously frozen ticking time bombs of molten processed cheese. The thin, flaky pastry shimmers with fat, but it's crackly and light and barely contains a core of nearly liquid hot burrata. An application of pepperoni oil—simply diced, cured sausage and oregano suspended in olive and Calabrian chile oils—spells true redemption for this wretched snack. On the side of a perfunctory cheeseburger there are fluffy, pale golden fries draped in a light cheddar Mornay sauce and scattered with pickled shishito, cayenne, and Calabrian chile peppers (the fries come with the beef sandwich too).\\nA few other Chicago referents are scattered around the menu as well, among them a roasted half chicken with tiny potatoes, carrots, and a few coins of preserved lemon—but without peas and a more serious application of lemon and oregano, which makes calling it chicken Vesuvio revisionist history. Four butterflied shrimp jacketed in an arresting green-colored herbal breading are certainly greasy enough for de jonghe, but look as if they sprang from the mind of Dr. Seuss. Less locally focused, an otherwise unobjectionable matzo ball soup advertised with shaved black truffle and foie gras schmaltz bears none of the former's hallmark aroma or the latter's livery richness.\\nOther less thematic dishes excel on their own merits. Serviceably thin potato pierogi on a pool of smoked creme fraiche are bedecked with jewellike salmon roe and grated cured egg yolk. Pity the poor chef de partie who peels the grapes for a salad of red leaf lettuce, shaved apples, and creamy lavender\\xadand-espresso-rubbed cheese, its overall sweetness cut with pumpkin-seed vinaigrette. Brilliant green arugula-infused pappardelle coil under a bolognese of mushrooms and root vegetables. A simple salmon fillet is engulfed by an nduja-fueled bouillabaise teeming with clams, mussels, and shrimp. A tiny serving of pork-cheek pot roast melts amid baby carrots, onions, and mushrooms.\\nIt's clear that the seasonal rather than the thematic elements on this menu work the best, and while there are plenty of likable dishes in addition to a few that ought to be retired early, nothing really hits it out of the park until it's time for dessert. Pastry chef Shawn Anderson-Calix's fanciful options include a butternut hand pie with carbonated grapes, a trifle with moonshine-compressed apples, and a brownie sundae with herbaceous chocolate-and-fernet ice cream. But it's the aforementioned churro souffle that seems likely to become the signature of Regards to Edith. An item not listed on the print menu that requires a good 20 minutes to grace the table, it's the kitchen's greatest weapon, a ramekin topped with a cinnamon sugar-dusted crust that when hit by a steaming stream of hot dark-chocolate sauce implodes into a warm, sweet bog of queso fresco and cream cheese that beckons like it's alive.\\nThe beverage program, by former Publican cicerone Michael McAvena, features a few treasures like the wonderfully funky and dry local Prima farmhouse cider, and cocktails like the Deli Counter Fish, vegetal with shaved celery and bison-grass vodka along with a bitter kiss of Malort.\\nI'm betting Regards to Edith will do a whole lot better in this spot than Smack Shack, the Minneapolis-based lobster pot that preceded it. That's assured if the weaker entries on the menu catch up to the stronger ones. v\", 'A little more than two years ago, the Chicago Tribune published an editorial urging the City Colleges of Chicago to sell its public television station, WYCC, channel 20.\\nBeginning with the assumption that WYCC was superfluous (given the existence of Chicago\\'s larger public television station, WTTW), the editorial argued that keeping it would be \"daft,\" since there was now \"a chance to sell the channel in a government auction for as much as $474 million.\"\\n\"You read that correctly: as much as $474 million for a community college TV station,\" the Tribune wrote.\\nMayor Rahm Emanuel was resisting a sale because CCC students were getting what he said was valuable experience at the studio, on the Englewood campus of Kennedy-King College, the editorial said.

Pay that off, and the net gain for the cash-strapped CCC from the sale could be as little as $6 million.\\nStation members and fans of its alternative programming (like Democracy Now!, In the Loop, and MHz Worldview) were shocked by the lowball price, but expected that, like many other stations in the spectrum auction, WYCC would continue operating by working out a channel-sharing agreement—most likely with WTTW. When it entered the auction, WYCC had said it would seek such an arrangement.\\nBut on November 27, the station went dark. What happened?\\nMedia watchdog Scott Sanders began looking into the sale as soon as the bewildering result was announced. Last week he published his findings on the video media and film-industry trade publication Reel Chicago. Even though the auction results in general failed to meet the high initial expectations, Sanders found that WYCC\\'s price was markedly lower than that of comparable stations, including those in the Chicago area. (WXFT, for example went for $126 million.) He concluded that WYCC should have sold for at least $100 million more than what it fetched.\\nThe auction was inspired by wireless companies\\' need for more bandwidth for their rapidly expanding mobile businesses. The transition from analog to digital had created surplus bandwidth in the broadcast spectrum, and the expectation was that the wireless companies would pay a premium price for the licenses to use it and the government would pocket a big chunk of the proceeds. Authorized by Congress in 2012, the sale was promoted as a way to raise cash that would help reduce the national debt.\\nBut the structure of the sale was devilishly complicated. FCC spokesman Charles Meisch told me that to eliminate any chance of corruption, the government was to function as middleman, purchasing the bandwidth from the sellers and then reselling it to the buyers. To facilitate that, two separate auctions were set up: The sellers (that is, the TV stations) were assigned a \"reverse\" auction process that started with high prices (like the $474 million estimate the Trib quoted) and worked its way down to figures that would mesh with what buyers were willing to pay. The buyers participated in a more traditional auction, where prices gradually rose.\\nSo no buyer bought directly from a seller. And here\\'s an important point: If, at any juncture, sellers thought the reverse-auction price was getting too low, they could opt out. If a station did that, it would retain its broadcast license but might be moved to a different part of the broadcast spectrum. The cost of the move would be covered by the government, and there shouldn\\'t be any perceptible change for its viewers.\\nThis is significant in retrospect because, as the bids for WYCC dropped below $100 million and then much lower, City Colleges didn\\'t drop out but like the proverbial frog in the pot over a fire, hung in till it was cooked.\\nWhy were the bids for WYCC\\'s bandwidth so much lower than those for comparable stations? And why, when the bids began to sink, didn\\'t CCC pull the trigger and get out?\\n\"Those are the questions we all want answered,\" says John Freberg, who—until last week, when all but four members of a staff that he says once numbered 36 were let go—was WYCC\\'s director of engineering and operations. According to Freberg, \"There\\'s no reason why WYCC would have been less valuable than other stations. From a technical standpoint, it should have been more valuable.\"\\nStation member, artist, and retired Northwestern professor Bert Menco has posted a petition at Change.org urging that the station, which he notes was especially valuable to people who don\\'t have cable, be kept alive. \"How can a public asset be sold—basically given away—without any public input?\" Menco asks. \"At the least, it\\'s extremely incompetent.\"\\nWYCC recently filed a request for a three-month extension of the window allowed for setting up a channel-sharing agreement. A second extension is possible, but as it stands, if no arrangement has been made by February 22, its license to continue broadcasting will expire.\\nCCC responded to questions about the sale and the station\\'s future with a written statement that said WYCC was \"not a core part of the institution\\'s academic function\"; that CCC will \"save $2-$3 million per year\" by getting rid of it; and that \"If CCC had jumped out of the auction earlier, it would have received $0.\"\\nAccording to the statement, CCC and the city \"raised questions with the FCC about the apparent differential in outcomes for stations that seemed similar,\" and was told that \"there was a difference in interference in the spectrum.\" (Both Sanders and Freberg disagree with this explanation; the FCC says additional factors such as antenna properties were involved.)\\nCCC says WTTW has approached it about acquiring the WYCC license, and City Colleges\\' board of trustees will be considering channel sharing and asset-purchase agreements at its December 7 meeting. If that deal goes through, CCC says, all future programming on WYCC\\'s channels will be determined by WTTW.\\nAs for paying down the national debt: Meisch says the total bandwidth sale at the auction amounted to $19.8 billion. The government netted about $7.3 billion. The national debt is now $20 trillion. v', 'Last December, Columbia released a collection of winter jackets based on the costumes in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. They were all only available in limited quantities, making them incredibly hard to find, but this year’s collection, based on the iconic outfits worn by Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Luke Skywalker in The Empire Strikes Back, might be harder to find than even a secret Rebel base.\\nColumbia’s Echo Base collection features two jackets and a parka inspired by the snowy weather gear worn in Empire, but each one looks like a near-perfect replica of the film’s actual costumes—just slightly streamlined so you can wear them to battle the cold without looking too Star Wars-obsessed. Each one also comes lined with Columbia’s Omni-Heat reflective fabric which means that should you find yourself lost in a frigid wasteland, you won’t need to slaughter a Tauntaun to stay warm—unless you just like the smell.\\nAdvertisement\\nYou’ll also find a handful of Star Wars Easter eggs hidden in each jacket, including the logo of the Rebel Alliance, and fun patches which include quotes from the film. At $400 each they’re not cheap, but you’re actually getting a solid winter coat for your money, in addition to a genuine collectible. These will be only be available in limited quantities when they go on sale in Columbia stores on December 8th at 12:01 in the morning.\\nAnd I’ll be right there refreshing.\\nHey all, Germain here, hijacking Andrew’s post for a second.

Since that article posted, I’ve added to my collection. But the one thing I’ve never been able to find, or afford, is a high-end reproduction of the coat. And yes, it’s $400. I write about movies for a living so $400 isn’t like, a purchase I make without thinking twice. But trust me, it’s not everyday that a company like Columbia makes officially-licensed jackets for The Empire Strikes Back. The Hoth jackets.

Within a couple of days, 600 had, and dozens of them at a time were stationed outside customs at the airport to assist asylum seekers, green card holders, and others concerned about potential legal challenges to their entry into this country.\\nThat was fortunate because the ban had created mass confusion. “We had green card holders come up to us asking if their green cards were going to be revoked,” says Sufyan Sohel, an attorney in the Chicago chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Lawyers were drafting petitions for habeas corpus, which challenged travelers’ extended detention, pretty much on the fly.\\nIt became clear early on that there needed to be some structure to what started as an organic movement, so Sohel and three other local attorneys—Iman Boundaoui and Jamie Friedland, who both work at major law firms, and Matt Pryor, who works with Cook County on federal antidiscrimination compliance—led the organizing efforts. They coordinated a schedule, ensuring that a handful of attorneys, out of a pool of more than 300 active volunteers, would be on hand around the clock in the first three months following the ban. “We wanted to be at the airport and just be visible so we could publicize what we were doing and gather info from people coming off flights,” Friedland says. They also arranged for malpractice insurance and found translators who could be on call to help with any language barriers.\\nAttorneys are no longer stationed at the airport, though should new travel restrictions be put into place, volunteers are on reserve—and are now just a phone call away. With the help of CAIR-Chicago, the group has added a 24-hour hotline for issues that arise. “It’s a beautiful thing to see everyone spring into action,” Boundaoui says. “It’s people saying, ‘Not in our city. Not in our home. Not in Chicago.’ ”', 'Terry Richardson arriving at the 2014 Vanity Fair Oscar Party in West Hollywood. Richardson, who has been accused of sexually exploiting models for years, will no longer have his photography published in some of the world’s top magazines. (Adrian Sanchez-Gonzalez AFP/Getty Images)\\nFashion is exasperating. Even when it tries to do the right thing, it often manages only to remind the world just how tone deaf it really is.\\nTerry Richardson is a fashion and celebrity photographer who has worked with an array of subjects, including Beyoncé, Miley Cyrus and former president Barack Obama. He is a skilled shooter, but one who has long had an extraordinarily sleazy reputation for being sexually abusive to models. In public, he’s recognizable thanks to his signature style, which includes work shirts, long sideburns, a mustache and eyeglasses that give him the incongruous look of a nerdy pornographer.\\nIn 2014, New York magazine published a profile of him detailing the often sordid nature of his work. While the story contained all the usual biographical data points and résumé highlights, it also made it clear that Richardson was known for being an awful person who regularly coerced models into sexually compromising circumstances. At the time the story was published, there were still people willing to defend Richardson, who took pains to acknowledge his accomplishments as a photographer. But after it ran, the magazine published a follow-up that included the personal stories of models who alleged that Richardson had been a sexual bully and worse. Richardson, for his part, seemed to view himself as a somewhat tortured and unfairly maligned artist who sometimes happened to work nude.\\nRichardson was mostly unscathed by the stories.\\n[James Scully’s radical idea for the fashion industry: Treat models like human beings]\\nNow, however, a certain mainstream segment of the fashion industry has decided to formally distance itself from him. The Daily Telegraph reported that in a leaked email from Condé Nast International, the publishing house banned Richardson from working for the company’s publications, which include such titles as Vogue and GQ. Any forthcoming photo shoots should be halted, the memo said. And any unpublished shoots pulled. (This does not mean that Richardson’s work has been purged from the archives. Indeed, the GQ website still hosts “The Best of Terry Richardson” photo gallery.)\\nThe facts of Richardson’s behavior have not changed over the past few years. Only the context. That roiling backdrop includes the denunciations of Harvey Weinstein and his predatory behavior in and around Hollywood; the allegations of sexual harassment and coverups against Fox News’ Roger Ailes and Bill O’Reilly; and the continued dismay by many that the current president once bragged on tape about groping women, has been accused of doing just that in real life, and hasn’t yet faced any repercussions.\\nWhile it’s a good thing that a media company has formally asked its editors-in-chief not to hire Richardson, it’s also the kind of move that engenders an eye-roll and a sigh. Why is it so challenging for fashion to take the lead? Why does this feel like a Johnny-come-lately decision to denounce reprehensible behavior — not because the behavior is inherently awful, but because it’s no longer cool?\\n[Dov Charney’s out at American Apparel. Have we reached ‘porn chic fatigue’?]\\nIn an industry that is overwhelmingly for and about women, fashion still manages to treat women — those who are young and powerless — like crap.\\nIt’s not just some narcissistic photographer with a warped definition of “consent.” It’s inhumane model bookers, self-indulgent designers, greedy stage parents and other creative types who treat women as something other than sentient, thoughtful, individuals. Fashion denounced Richardson. Finally. Sort of. But frankly, it doesn’t much matter. Such egregious behavior may no longer be cool, but it’s still in fashion.', \"He has been called to appear next month at a pretrial court hearing in which Mr. Van Dyke’s lawyers are seeking to learn the source of the information that Mr. Kalven published about the shooting long before the video was made public.\\nIt is the latest diversion from the central question of Mr. Van Dyke’s guilt or innocence, and another delay in what is now the most closely watched murder case in Chicago.\\nOn a single day two years ago, Mr. Van Dyke was charged in the shooting, the graphic video of the teenager’s death from a year earlier was released and Chicago erupted in protest.\\nSince then, the case has slowly crawled toward resolution. Mr. Van Dyke has pleaded not guilty but no trial date has been set. The venue of the trial — whether here or in a more distant county in Illinois — is a matter of contention. And it remains to be seen whether the case will be decided in a bench trial or by a jury.\\nThe showdown with Mr. Kalven was prompted by Mr. Van Dyke’s lawyer, who suggested that Mr. Kalven obtained leaked documents and may have passed along that information to witnesses of the shooting, influencing their accounts to investigators.\\nThe fight over Mr. Kalven’s sources threatens to push the start of the trial even further down the road, delaying legal proceedings that many Chicagoans say should have already begun. Mr. Kalven, the founder of the Invisible Institute, a local independent news organization, said he is prepared to fight what he sees as a broadside on his First Amendment rights. In a legal filing this month, his lawyer called the effort an “unjustified fishing expedition.” Mr. Kalven said in an interview that he is willing to testify — but not about his sources of information.\\n“The one thing that I’m clear about is that I’m not revealing my sources,” said Mr. Kalven, sitting in his office on the South Side this month as silver commuter trains swooshed by in the background. “If we’re going to have a full-blown First Amendment controversy over this, it’s going to take months or years.”\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nDaniel Herbert, Mr. Van Dyke’s lawyer and a former police officer, declined to be interviewed, citing a gag order imposed by Judge Vincent Gaughan of the Cook County Circuit Court. But Mr. Herbert’s efforts suggest that he may try to urge the judge to bar witnesses to the shooting from testifying at trial, on the grounds that their recollections were tainted by information Mr. Kalven passed along to them.\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The news of the teenager’s death on the Southwest Side of Chicago on the night of Oct. 20, 2014, received modest coverage in local news media. An article the next day in The Chicago Tribune, citing a police union spokesman, noted that Mr. McDonald was armed with a knife, behaving erratically. The report said that he had “allegedly lunged at police” before being fatally shot by an officer.\\nMr. Kalven remembers reading the article. “And then I turned the page,” he said.\\nBut less than a month later, he received a tip from a source, passed along by Craig B. Futterman, a former public defender who runs a civil rights clinic at the University of Chicago. The source said that the McDonald shooting was nothing like what had been reported, and that there was dashboard camera video to prove it. The tip led Mr. Kalven to a civilian who had seen the entire episode; with some prodding, Mr. Kalven persuaded the witness to talk. In January 2015, Mr. Kalven obtained the autopsy report — a painstaking record of 16 bullets fired into Mr. McDonald.\\nThe resulting story, “Sixteen Shots,” which appeared in Slate in February 2015, forced the case out of obscurity in the Police Department and at City Hall and into public view.\\nThe investigation into Mr. McDonald’s death upended Chicago. The police superintendent, Garry F. McCarthy, lost his job. So did the head of the Independent Police Review Authority. The mayor, Rahm Emanuel, refused to step down despite calls for his resignation and nightly demonstrations in the city. Anita Alvarez, the state’s attorney for Cook County, lost her re-election bid. The Justice Department opened an investigation into possible civil rights abuses by the Chicago Police Department.\\nIt wasn’t until a year after Mr. McDonald’s death — and after a judge told the city it had to release the video — that Mr. Van Dyke was charged with murder. He was the only officer among more than a half-dozen on the scene to fire a weapon at the teenager. Three other officers were indicted on state felony counts of conspiracy, official misconduct and obstruction of justice, accused of filing false reports and lying about what happened the night of Mr. McDonald’s death.\\nFor years, Mr. Kalven has investigated government misconduct from his vantage point as an independent journalist from the South Side and as the son of Harry Kalven Jr., a university professor who was an expert on the First Amendment and was known for having defended the comedian Lenny Bruce. His father died of a stroke when he was 26; Jamie took over the writing of his father’s unfinished book on the First Amendment, a project that took 12 years.\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nLater, Mr. Kalven turned to investigations of public housing in Chicago, and in 2005 the city tried to force him to give up his notes and other source materials for an article on police misconduct. He refused.\\nMr. Kalven says he is not sure if he will be forced to testify at next month’s hearing on the Van Dyke case, or if a brief prepared by his lawyer, Matthew Topic, will satisfy the judge.\\nHe says he is more concerned about Mr. Van Dyke’s trial, which could begin next spring. In 2015, the release of the video of Mr. McDonald’s death was a trauma for many Chicagoans and a window into police conduct; the trial is expected to consume the city’s attention.\\n“I sort of feel like when you swim across a body of water and you can’t see either shore,” Mr. Kalven said. “We’re in the middle of a large, historic thing. We could end up in a worse place rather than a better place.”\", \"VCG via Getty Images\\nRemember the Chinese company that offered a helping hand to Snap?

I called my thrilled parents and celebrated with friends. I’m from northeastern China and have an M.B.A. from Stanford, and was planning to stay in Silicon Valley to help start a company based on a promising new technology to improve the use of data. I was overjoyed because, historically, being selected in the lottery was a near guarantee that an applicant could remain in this country at least three more years.\\nBut at the end of July, I received the dreaded Request for Further Evidence from immigration authorities. I provided the extra information that United States Citizenship and Immigration Services asked for. In September, I got another request. I complied again. Finally, on Oct. 11, half a year after my celebration, I learned I had been denied a visa.\\nAfter earning law degrees in China and at Oxford, after having worked in Hong Kong as a lawyer at a top international firm, after coming to United States three years ago for an M.B.A. and graduating and joining a start-up, I was given just 60 days to leave the country. I have 17 days left.\\nIn the past, it was fairly safe to assume that once you were selected in the lottery, your H-1B petition would be accepted by immigration officials. In 2016, this happened about 87 percent of the time. But things began to change in April when the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice announced measures to increase scrutiny of the highly skilled applicants who use the H-1B program, and President Trump signed an executive order calling for federal agencies to suggest reforms to the program.\\nWhile it’s unclear exactly what percentage of petitions have been approved so far in 2017, requests for evidence like the ones I received have increased by 44 percent compared with last year , according to immigration statistics, strongly suggesting that more people are being denied than before Mr. Trump took office.\\nMany of my fellow international students are in situations similar to mine. Some had job offers from companies like Google, Apple and PwC when they learned that their applications had been denied or did not even make it into the lottery. For those whose employers have only United States offices, losing the lottery meant losing jobs and going home, with no real way to use the skills they were on the verge of contributing to the American economy.\\nAnd some classmates who, like me, were picked in the H-1B lottery last spring are still waiting for an answer. The Trump administration on April 3 announced that it would suspend the “premium processing” service that, for a fee, guaranteed applicants responses to their petitions within 15 days. This has caused problems for students who needed a quick decision because their work authorization expired over the summer or because they wanted to plan overseas trips that they couldn’t make while their status was in limbo. My mom had surgery for cancer in July, but I simply couldn’t go back to China to be with her and risk being denied at the border upon my return because I didn’t have H-1B approval.\\nMy two requests for evidence asked me to prove my job was a “specialty occupation” — that is, work that only someone with a bachelor’s degree or higher can do. My work involves artificial intelligence and big data, and my letters of support came from an authority in my industry and veteran start-up investor, and a Nobel Prize winner. But it wasn’t enough to convince the government that my job requires advanced skills.\\nWhile I gave up my law job and used my savings and my parents’ to pay my Stanford graduate school tuition, in the grand scheme of things, I know my situation is much better than that of many immigrants who are forced to leave this country: Just this week, thousands of Haitians in the United States learned that they may have to return to Haiti as a result of the administration’s decision to strip them of the Temporary Protected Status they were granted while their country recovered from disasters.\\nIt’s true that I’m brokenhearted about missing the chance to return to China to care for my mother (she insisted that I stay and pursue the visa that was her dream for me), but I’m not looking for sympathy. As much as I hate to leave, I know I will be fine.\\nRather, I’m frustrated, because I know I’m part of a pattern: America is losing many very skilled workers because of its anti-immigrant sentiment, and while this is a disappointing blow to me and my classmates, it will also be a blow to the United States’ competitiveness in the global economy. Tech giants such as Google and Tesla were founded by immigrants.\\nI can’t make sense of why an administration that claims to want this country to be strong would be so eager to get rid of us. We are losing our dreams, and America is losing the value we bring.\\nAs I make plans to go back to China, I find myself wondering: If I am not qualified to stay in the United States, then who is?\\nFrida Yu is a lawyer and entrepreneur.\\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .\\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A27 of the New York edition with the headline: Is Anyone Good Enough for an H-1B Visa?.

I\\'m really grappling with that.\"\\nLost in the din of daily public allegations of sexual harassment and assault perpetrated by rich and powerful men is a growing conversation about what happens after the media moves on to something else. What happens to the communities these men are a part of? What becomes of the relationships they\\'re entwined in? What happens to the people they hurt? The most common consequence to the airing of misconduct allegations against most of these men is their immediate exile from their workplaces and, presumably, some of their professional and social networks.\\nThough many are calling this moment in our culture a \"reckoning,\" there\\'s little substantive discussion in the media about what justice for survivors of harassment and assault—and accountability for the perpetrators—might look like. And not just for the billionaire movie producers and celebrities and politicians, but for the everyday perpetrators of sexual violence: our bosses, colleagues, relatives, friends, and acquaintances. Eighty percent of sexual assaults are perpetrated by people we know, not random strangers; many women have no choice but to live side by side with the men who harass, assault, or rape them. We cannot and will not exile them all. We can\\'t and won\\'t put them all behind bars or sue them into destitution. And we cannot assume that those are the consequences the victims would even want, or that those are the consequences that would put an end to the rape culture permeating our society.\\nWhich is why, perhaps, there\\'s now growing interest in models of addressing interpersonal violence that don\\'t rely on involving the legal system, corporate HR departments, or other formal institutions. Last Monday more than 100 students and community members packed an auditorium at Northwestern University to learn from educator and organizer Mariame Kaba about a method of grappling with sexual and other harm known as \"community accountability.\"\\nKaba, who\\'s spent decades working with survivors and perpetrators of sexual and domestic violence, opened the talk by explaining that the event had been planned months ago. It wasn\\'t meant as a response to current revelations or the #MeToo campaign. The violence now being spotlighted by the media has permeated women\\'s lives forever; Kaba works with women whose stories aren\\'t deemed important enough to touch off a nationwide \"reckoning\"—some of whom are punished for taking action to protect themselves against sexual violence.\\n\"I have no idea why you\\'re in the room, but what I hope you get out of the experience is a way of thinking about sexual violence and ending it that doesn\\'t rely on the death-making institutions of police and prisons and surveillance, which we\\'ve been using to supposedly eradicate rape,\" she said. \"People should know I\\'m an abolitionist,\" she added, \"I don\\'t believe the current system solves problems, I believe it creates more.\" She stressed that she wasn\\'t there to evangelize or convert anyone to her way of thinking or dissuade anyone who feels the police can help from calling 911. She also said she wouldn\\'t entertain arguments in which someone was taking the position of devil\\'s advocate. \"I\\'m not here to transform your mindset,\" Kaba said. That was work we had to personally choose to do.\\nWith that, she asked that her talk not be recorded or tweeted about in real time, that her photo not be taken, and that her words not be quoted by any members of the media who might be in attendance. \"I don\\'t want my words circulating without proper context.\"\\nWith Kaba\\'s permission, I\\'m paraphrasing the main arguments in her lecture and explaining the \"community accountability\" model of justice as she presented it.\\nIt was decades ago that anti-rape activists began to work on ways to remedy sexual violence against women without involving the legal system. The dehumanizing treatment many survivors faced from police, prosecutors, and judges when they decided to report being raped or assaulted spurred the vision behind community accountability as an alternative.\\nIn 1977, Santa Cruz Women Against Rape penned an \"open letter to the anti-rape movement,\" warning that while growing awareness of sexual assault was good, it was also accompanied by an increased drive to involve the criminal justice system in solving the problem. This drive was spearheaded by social service organizations that relied on government funding to operate (unlike the early rape crisis centers that were sustained by radical feminist groups), and therefore either eschewed criticism of law enforcement authorities or were actively seeking greater collaboration with them.\\n\"Attempts at \\'good relations\\' with the criminal justice system have served to co-opt our movement, and have led to the belief (or hope) that the criminal justice system can solve the problem of rape,\" they wrote. \"Yet, the sexist and racist nature of the criminal justice system only makes the problem worse. . . . The criminal justice system has shown itself to be unresponsive and insensitive to the needs of women. The ordeal of reporting a rape and seeing it through trial is made painful and degrading. Even if the individuals involved try to be pleasant and helpful, the processes and structure of the entire system remain hostile and unsupportive to rape victims. This is largely because the women involved have no power in the process: it is the police that decide if she was \\'really raped\\', the DA often decides that it isn\\'t a \\'good case\\' so won\\'t prosecute, and juries hesitate to convict a rapist.\"\\nThe writers went on to argue that more convictions wouldn\\'t solve the root causes of sexual assault. \"It is true that the conviction rate for rapists is very low. This is largely due to sexism and the sexist myths about rape in our culture. We abhor the reasons for this low conviction rate but that doesn\\'t mean that we should work for a high convictions rate. Those convicted of rape are most likely to be Third World and/or poor White men, as is true for convictions for nearly all other crimes. . . . Prisons themselves are incapable of changing rapists. Prison culture is much like that of the outside world, with all of the pressure intensified. Male sex roles, violence, and power relations which lead to rape in the first place, are strongly reinforced within prison. Rapists in prison don\\'t stop raping—they simply enforce their power over men weaker than themselves. Prisons don\\'t deal with the roots of the problem, they only add to the causes. Men getting out of prison have not learned new ways of relating to women and haven\\'t developed an analysis of why they rape or how to change. It is likely that they will rape again.\"\\nThis analysis continues to ring true 40 years later. According to the Department of Justice\\'s Bureau of Justice Statistics as well as non-government groups, rape and sexual assault are vastly underreported. And even when they are reported, very few alleged perpetrators are ultimately convicted of any crime. Rates of sexual assault in jail and prison (mostly perpetrated by staff ) are high, particularly against women and LGBTQ prisoners. And recidivism by people convicted of sexual offenses, while not as frequent as once purported, is still a reality.\\nKaba encouraged the audience to think about sexual violence on a spectrum of harm, and that while not all of us will rape someone, all of us do harm other people—if not to their bodies, then at least to their feelings. The community accountability process is informed by this view and can offer a way to mitigate harm not just from the acts that society considers criminal, but from the kinds of acts that hurt us on a daily basis: the passive aggressive behavior of a colleague, the biting criticism of a parent, the shaming by siblings or spouses. Much like therapy, the community accountability process offers a framework to consider how that harm affects our lives and relationships, and also offers the person who harmed a chance to understand what they did to cause pain and own up to their actions. Ultimately, accountability can\\'t be imposed, Kaba explained—it must be chosen by the person who inflicted harm. That can\\'t happen if the person doesn\\'t own the fact that something he or she did, whether or not it was intentional, caused another person pain and suffering.\\nPart of what perpetuates rape culture, Kaba also noted, is that we currently offer no incentive to people to own their harmful actions. Sure, some people still do, but as we\\'ve seen in the cascade of scandals in the upper echelons of power, most of the accused will deny wrongdoing, presumably for fear of litigation, criminal prosecution, or further disgrace. We don\\'t work very hard to promote notions of justice that don\\'t revolve around punishment, so is it any wonder that the people who hurt others rarely own it? We\\'re not taught how to empathize with the mental reckoning of the people we deem to be villains, and so we don\\'t know much about how it might work or what we might do to prompt it.\\nAnd when we\\'re confronted with the reality that most \"villains\" aren\\'t John Wayne Gacy or Reginald McFadden or Danny Heinrich—that they might be men we admire and love—we find ourselves in Gayle King\\'s shoes. We\\'re at a loss as to what to think and do.\\nThe community accountability process begins not by outsourcing the investigation of allegations and dispensing of punishment to representatives of the state, but by centering the person who was harmed. It can begin with just a couple of friends talking with the victim about the incident and how the person envisions justice. The process often requires someone taking on the role of a facilitator (in the way that a couples therapist might) to mediate between the party alleging harm, the alleged, and the wider community impacted. A facilitator doesn\\'t have to be a credentialed professional, but this person must understand that the process requires checking participants for oppressive acts so that the process itself doesn\\'t become a vehicle for further harm or mob justice.\\nFor those interested in understanding the ins and outs of the process, Kaba pointed in the direction of an extremely thorough toolkit created by Creative Interventions of Oakland, California. There are also extensive community accountability resources curated by Incite, whose members have been pioneering this movement for decades. And in Chicago, various organizations previously profiled by the Reader already practice community accountability.\\nKaba summarized the bedrock principles of the community accountability process: that it can be a pathway to justice for those who don\\'t feel safe involving police, that it should be a choice, that it\\'s not a cure-all, that it can help establish lines of communication between people, that it doesn\\'t require forgiveness, and that it can take a very long time (months, even years). That pace reflects a realistic timeframe in which people are capable of growth, change, and healing.\\nShe concluded the talk with a quote from Rebecca Farr of Communities Against Rape and Abuse, which has also published a guide to community accountability:\\n\"I am not proposing that sexual violence and domestic violence will no longer exist. I am proposing that we create a world where so many people are walking around with the skills and knowledge to support someone that there is no longer a need for anonymous hotlines. I am proposing that we break through the shame of survivors (a result of rape culture) and the victim-blaming ideology of all of us (also a result of rape culture), so that survivors can gain support from the people already in their lives. I am proposing that we create a society where community members care enough to hold an abuser accountable so that a survivor does not have to flee their home. I am proposing that all of the folks that have been disappointed by systems work together to create alternative systems. I am proposing that we organize.\"', \"Uber executives deliberately took steps to conceal an October 2016 cyberattack, which exposed 57 million people's data, according to a new report from Bloomberg.\\nThis included a payment of $100,000 to the two hackers who had accessed the data in exchange for their promise to keep quiet and delete the information, according to the report.\\nUber acknowledged on Tuesday that two individuals in October 2016 had accessed and downloaded data on 57 million Uber riders and drivers that was stored in a third-party infrastructure system. The company says none of its own systems were breached.\\nAs part of the cyberattack, the names and driver license numbers of around 600,000 drivers were accessed, according to Uber. 57 million Uber users also had their information exposed, including names, emails, and mobile phone numbers, the company said in a blog post.

(Well, and anguish.) At the very time when, it seems, Americans have finally begun to take sexual predation seriously and impose meaningful consequences on men who abuse their power, the far right has shot off in the opposite direction like a dog with a ham in its mouth.\\nSure, previously untouchable cultural behemoths like Harvey Weinstein and Louis C.K. are watching their legacies crumble around them, but, in the same news cycle, Republicans are smashing their expensive coffee makers in defense of a man who is alleged to have sexually assaulted minors and the president of the United States has been accused of sexual misconduct so many times that the accusations have their own Wikipedia page. Newton’s Third Law, I guess.\\nIt has been particularly illuminating to watch the comedy community process the toppling of one of its sacred man-boys. Many people — myself included, at one time — consider Louis C.K. to be the greatest living stand-up comic, an astute, self-effacing, disgusting, loving dad who managed to win over not just the morning talk radio boys’ club but tougher crowds like feminists and art snobs (maybe because none of us listened to what he was saying to the talk radio boys’ club).\\nHis 2013 HBO special “Oh My God” was praised for its frank acknowledgment of rape culture (acknowledgment may be a low bar, but it’s all we had in a pre-Cosby landscape). Louis C.K. called men “the No. 1 cause of injury and mayhem to women” and pointed out that for women, spending time alone with a man requires “courage.” I suppose he would know.\\n“Oh My God” came out a year after Gawker published a blind item alleging that a beloved comedian, widely whispered to be Louis C.K., had exposed himself and masturbated in front of multiple women without their consent. The special was, presumably, written in that intervening year, and in retrospect, it’s difficult not to read the “injury and mayhem” joke in particular as a shrewd calculation.\\nThe same adept calculation saturates the statement that the comedian put out on Friday, a day after the allegations against him were made public. In his “apology” he mentions his anatomy multiple times, but the words “I’m sorry” not once. On the surface, he convincingly telegraphs contrition and a deep disgust at his own weaknesses, but disarming self-flagellation has always been his art. The careful message is “I, one man, made one mistake,” not “I, among many others, preyed upon vulnerable women in my industry, on purpose, because I am both a defender and a beneficiary of an entrenched system of oppression.” It’s easier to get your old job back if the power structure that gave it to you in the first place stays intact.\\nI am tired of calculation. If we’re having a reckoning, let’s have a full reckoning.\\nThis week, the comedian Marc Maron, a friend and contemporary of Louis C.K. , devoted his podcast’s opening monologue to the comedian’s transgressions and the gendered power dynamics in comedy. He acknowledged that comedy is a boys’ club and that he used to think female comics just needed to be funny and to “fight it out,” without realizing what else they had to deal with, specifically: “They have to deal with all of us.”\\nIt’s among the most honest, cathartic admissions we’ve heard from comedy’s old guard, and I appreciate it. But I’m baffled by Maron’s apparent surprise at the structural inequality within his industry. A great many people have been pointing out women’s disadvantages in comedy for a very long time. Those people are called women. In return, we’ve been abused, discredited, blacklisted, turned into punch lines and driven out of the industry.\\nIn 2012, Louis C.K. appeared on “The Daily Show” and said that “comedians and feminists are natural enemies” because “feminists can’t take a joke.” Jon Stewart nodded vigorously and agreed. Today, Stewart is being fawned over for acknowledging, in response to Louis C.K.’s fall, that “comedy on its best day is not a great environment for women.” A friend, the comedian Zahra Noorbakhsh, texted me: Ten years from now a man will win awards for his documentary about all this.\\nIf you believe us now only because your peers are facing professional ruin, that deserves its own reckoning. I’ll wait.\\nOne of comedy’s defining pathologies, alongside literal pathologies like narcissism and self-loathing, is its swaggering certainty that it is part of the political vanguard, while upholding one of the most rigidly patriarchal hierarchies of any art form. Straight male comedians, bookers and club owners have always been the gatekeepers of upward mobility in stand-up, an industry where “women aren’t funny” was considered conventional wisdom until just a few years ago.\\nThe solution isn’t more solemn acknowledgments from powerful male comedians. We have those. The solution is putting people in positions of power who are not male, not straight, not cisgender, not white. This is not taking something away unfairly — it is restoring opportunities that have been historically withheld. And if we address the power imbalance in comedy, in this art that shapes how people think, what jokes they repeat to their families, who they believe deserves to hold a microphone and talk out loud, other imbalances might follow.\\nThere’s an old Louis C.K. joke that starts: “Divorce is always good news. I know that sounds weird, but it’s true, because no good marriage has ever ended in divorce.”\\nI know it’s hard, but this is the best thing that has happened to comedy in a long time.\\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .\\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A23 of the New York edition with the headline: Why Men Aren’t Funny.

For a spoiler-free review, click here.]\\n“Where’s BoJack?” The question at the center of Netflix’s Season 4 marketing efforts is treated differently in the series itself. Yes, at the onset of the new episodes, BoJack is missing. No one knows where he is; not his former roommate, Todd (Aaron Paul), not his former crush, Diane (Alison Brie), not even his best friend, Channing Tatum (no footage found): The would-be Oscar nominee and former TV star isn’t even in the first episode, sans for a botched voicemail recording heard by Diane.\\nBut Season 4 tackles its central query from an aptly existential angle: Where is BoJack? Throughout Raphael Bob-Waksberg’s excellent animated series, BoJack has always been drifting. Facing and fearing a confusing world, he’s trapped in a circle of meaningless self-destruction. He drinks and parties as means to relieve pain, even when those same habits cause more harm.\\nHis life is a mystery he desperately needs to solve, and Season 4 reframes the events of past seasons as honest, but failed efforts to crack the case. In Season 1, he looks for love in all the wrong places. Season 2 finds him trying to ignore his problems under a false veil of positivity, while last season sees him discover the shallow rewards of unearned recognition. He’s tried to fill the gap in his soul with work, shortcuts, and other people, but Season 4 sees him taking the time to examine just that: time, and its ravaging effects on the mind.\\nTime, Time, Time\\nDays fly by at the speed of life in Season 4. The opening episode picks up three months after BoJack disappeared and runs through events over the course of a month. Updating the audience on past events — Mr. Peanutbutter is running for governor, and Diane is writing for a blog called Girl Croosh — and progressing the current story, Episode 1 speeds through 30 days in less than 30 minutes.\\nEpisode 2 goes even faster. Whole seasons pass as BoJack renovates his grandfather’s house. From all that time, he learns not to build a mosaleum to the past and decides to move back to Los Angeles in order to move forward with his life. But Season 4 continues to toy with time’s elasticity, from the 10 days spent trapped in Mr. Peanutbutter’s collapsed house during Episode 7 to the false future presented in Princess Carolyn’s tragic solo tale in Episode 9.\\nUltimately, BoJack gets a pass. Time cuts him some slack and instead of forcing early fatherhood upon him — or robbing him of decades as a father — the woman he thought was his long-lost daughter turns out to be the sister he needs right now. BoJack’s father was Hollyhock’s father, not BoJack, as she proves to be the baby Henrietta gave up for adoption on Beatrice’s insistence. In the final scene of Season 4, Hollyhock calls BoJack and says, “I never needed a dad, but I’ve never had a brother?”\\nFramed as a question and answered in BoJack’s excited smile, the line drives home his progress. While BoJack admitted earlier in the season how terrified he was of being responsible for another human life, a sister — a family member he’s not responsible for, but can still be friends with — is exactly what he needs. Hollyhock is like a baby step toward a better life; toward maturity, accountability, pride, and happiness. She’s not a lover he can drive away or a daughter he can screw up. She’s just…present, in his life, for good.\\nThe Best Episode of Season 4\\nThe relationship runs in direct contrast to what we saw in the penultimate episode — the season’s strongest entry, and one of the best “BoJack” episodes to date. Episode 11 dives head first into BoJack’s mother and her fractured relationship with time. Dementia-afflicted and nearing her death, Beatrice had responsibility thrust upon her before she was ready, and she — as well as BoJack — paid the price.\\nBeatrice was a child raised to dislike her father and, later, men in general. Her dad burned all of her things when she got sick, including a doll she thought of as her baby. He also subjected Beatrice’s mother to a lobotomy because, to paraphrase a direct quote from the series, as a man, he wasn’t conditioned to deal with women’s emotions.\\nWhether the distrust and dislike was as bluntly evoked as the series’ dialogue (a.k.a. Beatrice’s memory) made it out to be, or just horrifyingly scarring in its intentions, the next two major men in her life did equal damage. BoJack’s father knocked her up, proposed because of the pregnancy, and then spent the rest of his life mooching off of her family money and cheating on her. Then came BoJack, an innocent child who nonetheless served as a living reminder of Beatrice’s sacrifice. He wasn’t worth it — not to her, not at that price.\\nBeatrice was a woman who had a fling — just like BoJack’s many, many one-night stands — and it cost her more than it ever cost her son. She became bitter and angry, living and unloved life. Could she have handled it better? Perhaps, but Season 4 emphasizes the damaging role institutionalized sexism plays on framing Beatrice’s hopeless perspective.']\n"
